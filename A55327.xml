            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE OF <hi>TRADE</hi> and <hi>COYN.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUR Naval Strength, Value of Lands, Increaſe of Riches, Imployment of the Poor, and Preſervation of the Coyn and Bullion we have, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on <hi>Trade;</hi> it is convenient that all Perſons ſhould be ſenſible how much the Publick, as well as their Private Intereſt is concerned, in the promoting of it, that a due inſpection may be made into it; and ſuch Trades as are Good and Profitable for the Nation be incouraged, ſuch as are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous and Pernicious, diſcouraged, that the ballance may ſtand in our favour, otherwayes whether we compleat the work begun, of reſtoring our <hi>Coyn,</hi> to its former Weight and Purity, or leave it to the mercy of the Clippers, we ſhall be in danger of being drain'd of what we have in a few
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34988:6"/>Years, which affords a dreadful proſpect of Poverty and Inſecurity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Coyn</hi> have ſuch a dependance one upon the other, that they could not well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd diſtinctly; therefore though the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may appear confuſed, yet the Matter may be the more intelligible, the repeating or interfering with other Mens Notions, that have writ upon the ſame Subjects, could not be avoided.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom is ſo well ſcituated for the carrying on of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſo well provided with Staple Commodities fit for Foreign Markets, and with Ships and Seamen to make good uſe of thoſe benefits, that nothing but a long ſupine Careleſneſs in matters of <hi>Trade,</hi> Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious prodigal way of Living, and Ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Advantages we have; could have brought us into this Danger.</p>
                  <p>Hopes of Gain may be ſaid to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Trade.</hi> No Gentleman would put his Son to be an Apprentice to any Trading Man, but in Expectation he may get an Eſtate, or at leaſt a Livelyhood by it. No Man would adventure his Money in <hi>Trade,</hi> if he had not hopes thereby to increaſe it. This drawes as the Loadſtone the Needle; and it is well 'tis ſo, otherwiſe there would be no good Reaſon to expect we ſhould have much <hi>Trade:</hi> Therefore in Conſiderations of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Coyn,</hi> Arguments from Intereſt ought to be taken for as good Proof as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34988:6"/>
                  <p>Though there may be ſome Circumſtances in the Management of Trades that may be Secrets, and kept by every Tradeſman to himſelf, and Myſterious to others, yet as it relates to the great ends before mentioned, <hi>Trade</hi> is only a Myſtery to ſuch, who have not time, or will not imploy their Thoughts about it.</p>
                  <p>Nations compared with other Nations,<note place="margin">Ballance of <hi>Trade.</hi>
                     </note> may in moſt caſes be conſidered as great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or Merchants, or Traders, as to their Dealings one with another. That which is called the ballance of <hi>Trade,</hi> is no more a Myſtery, as to the meaning of it, then what is meant by the ballance of an Accompt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Gentleman and his Steward, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Merchants and Shopkeepers; And though the Accompts of the <hi>Trades,</hi> between Nation and Nation, are not ſo kept as that can be made up exactly, yet ſuch Methods may be taken as may produce a ſatisfactory Judgment, for the end deſigned, of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering what <hi>Trades</hi> carry out our Coyn or Bullion, or may deſerve Incouragement or Diſcouragement.</p>
                  <p>When we take from any Nation more Goods, or by any Contract or Dealings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more indebted to any Nation then ſuch Nation to us, by the Goods taken from us, the overplus (which may properly be called the Ballance) muſt be paid in Bullion, Coyn, Jewels, or ſome ſuch Treaſure, which is uſually carried off privately, or elſe by Bills of Exchange, the Product of Goods remitted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34988:7"/>to ſome other Country; which in moſt Caſes will, upon Examination, appear to be the ſame in effect, as if it were Treaſure carried out hence.</p>
                  <p>If we did take from <hi>France</hi> formerly, as many <hi>Wines, Brandies</hi> and <hi>Silks,</hi> and other Goods, as amounted to a Million <hi>per Annum,</hi> we did then by taking thoſe Goods from them, become Debtors to that Nation for a Million: And if the Goods we ſold to them, or they took from us, amounted to but half a Million, then the other half Million, upon the Ballance, muſt be owing to that Nation; which we may be ſure they did not give us, or left unrecovered, but took it from us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Money, Jewels,</hi> or ſome ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for pay themſelves, in all ſuch Caſes, the <hi>Merchants</hi> will ſome way or other, at ſuch times and ſeaſons as they find it moſt convenient for them.</p>
                  <p>The like with all other Nations, whether our Debts be contracted by Commodities taken from them, by way of <hi>Trade,</hi> or by borrowing Money upon <hi>Loans,</hi> or by ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Payments of <hi>Armies</hi> or <hi>Fleets,</hi> or any other way: What is not paid in <hi>Goods</hi> will ſome way or other be paid, and carried off from us in <hi>Bullion, Coyn, &amp;c.</hi> as may turn beſt to account to ſuch Creditors, when our <hi>Goods</hi> do not in any Country turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſo well as <hi>Bullion,</hi> either by our own People to buy <hi>Goods</hi> or pay Debts there, or the Strangers that bring ſuch <hi>Goods</hi> here, or are become our Creditors by any Dealings,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34988:7"/>will leave our <hi>Goods</hi> and carry out our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> and what is thus carried out is uſually ſaid to be, to ballance ſuch a <hi>Trade,</hi> and is that which may properly be called, The bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No <hi>Trades</hi> can be more ſecure,<note place="margin">Thoſe <hi>Trades</hi> Good that Export our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts.</note> to be for the Intereſt of this Nation, then what are carried on by the Exportation of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and Manufactories, or by ſuch Goods as come here from our Plantations, becauſe of the Advantages we have by the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Conſumption of our Product, and Imployment of the Poor; but no <hi>Trade</hi> is more likely to increaſe Seamen, than our <hi>Fiſhing-Trade</hi> is; becauſe great numbers (as well as ſome Landmen which thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Seamen) are imployed in the taking, and making, as well as in carrying it to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Markets; and no <hi>Trade</hi> can produce more clear Profit to the Nation, becauſe the whole Value ariſeth from the Labours of our People, excepting the <hi>Salt. Trades</hi> that have ſo good a foundation ſhould be promoted; becauſe not ſo difficult to judge what <hi>Trades</hi> are good by the Exportation, as what are bad by Importation.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Trades</hi> carried on by the Exportation of our Products or <hi>Fiſh</hi> cannot be pernicious, ſo <hi>Trades</hi> carried on by the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> are dangerous; no ſuch Advantage in the Exportation, rather the contrary; and ought only to be approved of for the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Goods in Foreign parts to be carried to Foreign Markets, from whence there may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34988:8"/>be a probability that the Returns will bring in more <hi>Bullion</hi> than was carried out; or for purchaſing Goods for perfecting ours, or for another Manufactory here, as <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Wooll, &amp;c.;</hi> or of ſuch Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as are abſolutely neceſſary for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Safety, as <hi>Naval Stores,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had elſewhere on better terms.</p>

                     </note> and allowed in ſome places to be with as much impunity Exported as any others, as in <hi>Holland, Florence, Genoua</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> yet it doth not follow that it may be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient here to incourage it; for though thoſe Countries may grow Rich, yet we may grow Poor by it.</p>
                  <p>Where a Place or Country is ſcituated convenient for <hi>Trade,</hi> with good Harbours, but not provided with plenty of ſtaple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of their own growth or fabrick, as thoſe places aforementioned, there Free ports or Freedom of <hi>Trade,</hi> without Limitations, may be convenient, as the only way to bring <hi>Trade,</hi> and increaſe it; and the Gains which ariſe to the Prince, State or People of thoſe Countries by ſuch <hi>Trade,</hi> are by the Duties paid, and by the Charges and Expences the Ships and Merchandizes leave behind them; and what may be got by the People of thoſe Countries, is by Buying, Selling and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Foreign Commodities more than by their own; and the <hi>Money</hi> carried out, not much of the Country <hi>Coyn;</hi> for it would probably be found, if a true account could
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34988:8"/>be given, that none of thoſe places had any great ſtore of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> when they gave that liberty at firſt; and that the plenty of it now there, as it came firſt, ſo can only be preſerved by continuing the ſame <hi>Trade;</hi> it being likely, that if a ſtop ſhould be put to it, they would ſoon find a decreaſe of <hi>Trade,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe they are not well ſtored with Commodities of their own, what they have being moſt brought from Foreign parts; or the Materials they are fabrickt with, not poſſible to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by them but by <hi>Money;</hi> ſuch Nations are as Store-keepers of the Goods of Foreign Nations, which being by their own Ships, or of Strangers, Tranſported to Foreign parts, afford them great Profit; as the <hi>Dutch</hi> by their <hi>Spices</hi> from <hi>India, Linnens</hi> from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and other Commodities in abundance.</p>
                  <p>Though it be granted that our <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> cannot afford us any increaſe while kept within the Kingdom, yet it being that in which the Riches of the Nation doth ſo much conſiſt, and ſo neceſſary for the Payment of Fleets and Armies, and carrying on of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that we cannot be Safe, nor Rich, without it; this Nation being ſo well ſtored with Staple Commodities of our own growth, as well as others, from our Plantations, and other places for Exportation, it may be ſaid, we rather want <hi>Trade</hi> than <hi>Stock.</hi> But if it ſhould be thought we want <hi>Stock,</hi> it is more our Intereſt to apply our ſelves to increaſe our Products and Manufactories, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34988:9"/>of them, and to retrieve our <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade,</hi> to add to our <hi>Stock,</hi> then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> which is the ſame in effect as the Exportation of our <hi>Coyn;</hi> there being little difference between the allowing Exportation of <hi>Bullion</hi> only, or <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Coyn</hi> both</p>
                  <p>For when there is not <hi>Bullion</hi> to ſupply the <hi>Merchants</hi> occaſions for Exportation, the Price will advance; which if but Three Pence <hi>per</hi> Ounce above our Coyned <hi>Silver,</hi> reckoning Ounce to Ounce, it did formerly, when our Milled and Weighty Money was plenty, afford a ſufficient temptation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for thoſe that had culled and laid by the Weightieſt, to melt it down, that it might be called <hi>Bullion,</hi> Sold and Exported, as it is well known hath been practiced for vaſt Sums, ſince the Act for allowing the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Bullion:</hi> For after General or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pardons, few of thoſe that practiced it, thought it worth denying.</p>
                  <p>Before Countenance ſhould be given to <hi>Trades</hi> carryed on by the Exportation of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> an Exact Inquiry ſhould be made, what Returns we ſhall have for it, or wherein it will be Advantageous to the Nation; and if it appear, that except for the Uſes aforeſaid, for Stores or Goods for a further Manufactory, no <hi>Trade</hi> carried on by the Exportation of <hi>Bullion</hi> can bring us in any Returns, but what muſt be conſumed in Luxury, or Prodigality, or hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our own Manufactures, we ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34988:9"/>make but a bad Exchange. If we ſhould approve of its going out for any ſuch Goods, and being ſuch <hi>Trades</hi> cannot promote the advancing of Lands, imploying of the Poor, nor the increaſe of our Navigation by the Exportation, which are the chief ends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by <hi>Trade,</hi> if they ſhould be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, we may find, when too late, that as <hi>Trade</hi> brought <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo it may carry it out again.</p>
                  <p>Prohibitions againſt the Exportation of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> have never had any good effect in any Country. It is by Law a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Crime in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> yet it is Shipt off from thence as frequently, as if there were no ſuch Law; and we have reaſon to ſuſpect that our Laws here againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our <hi>Coyn,</hi> have had but little better ſucceſs. The removing of the Cauſe, or the making of ſuch a <hi>Trade</hi> Unprofitable, can only aſſord a Remedy in any ſuch caſe; for where Temptations are great and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions private, though ſome out of Fear, or Conſcience, may not adventure to break ſuch Laws, yet others will.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the Raiſing or Clipping of our <hi>Coyn</hi> much hinder the Exportation, becauſe <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> that is carried out to a Foreign Nation can only be for payment of Debts made, or intended to be contracted, (unleſs the Owners reſolve to remove their Perſons alſo, or give it away) the word Debt being taken at large, whether for Goods bought, or intended to be bought, by way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34988:10"/>or for diſcharging the Expences of Armies, or of Embaſſadors, or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that travel making Preſents, requite Obligations, or Money Lent us on Publick Funds: All theſe, or the like ingagements with any Foreign Nation, bring us in Debt to that Nation as much as ſuch ingagements may import; and what is not paid by our Goods or Products, or the proceed of them, either the Natives of that Country muſt quit and forgive us, or it muſt be paid in <hi>Bullion,</hi> or ſome ſuch Treaſure.

                  <p>In ſuch a Caſe, as Perſons in their Private Concerns ſo Nations will act, if a particular Trader that owes great Sums of Money to ſeveral Perſons will ſhut himſelf up in his Houſe, and be peremptory he will pay but Sixteen Shillings of the Pound, and it appears to his Creditors that they muſt take that, or run a hazard of loſing all, it is probable that in ſuch a Caſe, ſome will take his Goods, others his Debts, others his Money, and be careful how they deal with him again, unleſs upon ſecure Terms.</p>

                  <p>The Exchange of <hi>Money</hi> for <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>Bills</hi> for <hi>Money,</hi> between Nation and Nation, is a great <hi>Trade</hi> of it ſelf; many Perſons in Trading Cities, make it their chief, if not only Imployment, to take <hi>Money</hi> when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and draw <hi>Bills</hi> for it on their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents, which they have in moſt parts and places where there is any <hi>Trade</hi> carried on, and their Correſpondents to reimburſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Redraw on them, or on their Agents in other places as may receive Directions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34988:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>and as the Rates of Exchange may induce them; which at laſt muſt be repaid by the firſt Drawer, either by <hi>Goods</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> ſent out hence, or by the payment of <hi>Bills</hi> that may be drawn on him. By which <hi>Trade</hi> thus carried on without Buying, Selling, or Trading much in Goods, they uſually get much more than Intereſt by their Money, and in a courſe of Years conſiderable Eſtates; others that do not make Exchange their ſole <hi>Trade,</hi> draw Bills upon many occaſions to be paid out of the product of Goods, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſent and lodged in their Correſpondents hands for that purpoſe. Theſe wayes of Trading by Exchange hath proved of ſo great uſe in the carrying on of <hi>Trade,</hi> for the ſpeedy ſupply of Money upon Occaſions, leſſening of Adventures, and getting quick Returns; that it may be ſaid, Exchange is to ſome <hi>Trades</hi> as the firſt Foundation, or as a Pendulum to a Watch to keep it in Motion; and being ſo, hath a great influence on the Price of Commodities, which will alwayes much depend upon the Rate of Exchange, and the Rate of Exchange upon the Weight and Fineneſs of the <hi>Coyn;</hi> like ſo many Links of a Chain, if one be drawn the others will follow.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe that make it their Buſineſs to give <hi>Bills</hi> for <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> for <hi>Bills,</hi> know the Intrinſick Value of the <hi>Coyns</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to which they deal; and the Natural Rate for all Countries, amounts to giving One Hundred Pound weight of <hi>Silver</hi> in one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34988:12"/>Country, for a Hundred Pound weight of <hi>Silver,</hi> of the ſame Fineneſs, in another Country, with as much difference as may be a Temptation to the <hi>Bankers,</hi> or <hi>Exchangers,</hi> to continue their <hi>Trade,</hi> more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſtance of Place, Time for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Plenty or Scarcity of <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Bills,</hi> which oftentimes makes it conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But taking it without ſuch Accidents and Conſiderations, the Rates are a Hundred Pound weight, for a Hundred Pound weight in another Country, or very near. The Old <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>France</hi> did formerly anſwer in Weight and Fineneſs to 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the Exchange then uſually went at 54 <hi>d.</hi> here for a <hi>Crown</hi> to be paid in <hi>France.</hi> The Old <hi>Shilling</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> anſwered to 7 <hi>d.</hi> or better, the Exchange for <hi>Holland</hi> uſually at 36 <hi>s.</hi> there, for 20 <hi>s.</hi> here. To imagine that if our <hi>Coyn</hi> be Raiſed One Fifth Part here, the Exchange for Foreign Countries will not Advance proportionable, is to ſuppoſe that Men will act contrary to Reaſon and their true Intereſt, and give One Hundred Pound weight of <hi>Silver</hi> in a Foreign Country, for Eighty Pound weight received here; when it may turn much better to account to them to bring it here, and have it Coyned in the <hi>Mint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Inſtance: After ſuch an Advance, a <hi>Merchant</hi> comes to a <hi>Banker,</hi> and demands a Bill for <hi>Paris</hi> for 100 <hi>l.,</hi> and offers for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>French Crown</hi> to be paid in <hi>Paris</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> as the Price uſually went before Advanced,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34988:12"/>and it then anſwered in Weight and Fineneſs to our <hi>Money</hi> here: If the <hi>Banker</hi> agree to it, then he muſt give a Bill for 444 <hi>Crowns</hi> ⅖, for ſo many times 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> will be found to be in 100 <hi>l.</hi> and muſt receive 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> here of our <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe will then be called 100 <hi>l.;</hi> which he will ſoon find is not his Intereſt to do: For the 444 <hi>French Crowns</hi> ⅖ brought here, and Coyned, will make 400 of our <hi>Crowns;</hi> and after ſuch an Advance of our <hi>Coyn,</hi> will produce him at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per Crown,</hi> 125 <hi>l.</hi> And therefore we may conclude, <hi>Bills</hi> will be refuſed for <hi>Paris, Spain,</hi> or any where, unleſs the Exchange advance proportionable to the <hi>Coyn:</hi> But though this be offered as Demonſtration, that the Rates of Exchanges will Advance, yet not that it will occaſion the bringing in of Money to be Coyned; for if Goods, and all Contracts in the way of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſhould alter (as is ſuppoſed) proportionable to the <hi>Coyn,</hi> then his 125 <hi>l.</hi> ſo made, will do no more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than 100 <hi>l.</hi> before; and therefore the advancing of <hi>Coyn,</hi> no Temptation for the bringing in of <hi>Bullion,</hi> unleſs for payment of Debts contracted before ſuch Advance.</p>
                  <p>And as it cannot be expected that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of <hi>Money</hi> for <hi>Bills</hi> ſhould go on at the rate as before, ſo that any ſort of <hi>Wrought Plate</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> ſhould be ſold at the ſame Price: For how can it be imagined that any Man will Exchange One Hundred Pound weight for Eighty Pound weight of the ſame Metal; which carried into the <hi>Mint,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34988:13"/>Coyned, would yield One Fifth more? And though the ſame Reaſons cannot be given for the Advance of all other Commodities, yet Dealings by Exchange have ſuch an influence upon <hi>Trade,</hi> and the giving high Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Coyn,</hi> ſo unlikely to make it paſs for more than its Intrinſick Value, according to its Weight, that it is contrary to reaſon to expect, that Foreign Nations will barter their Commodities for it, rather in proportion to the Name, than Value; and if it have that effect with Foreign Nations, as may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and our own Goods ſhould not Riſe alſo proportionable, then will prove but a contrivance to make us ſell our Goods to Strangers at one Rate, and buy of them at another.</p>
                  <p>The true Intrinſick Value of <hi>Silver</hi> in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of <hi>Silver</hi> ever was, and will be, an Ounce for an Ounce; an Ounce Coyned for an Ounce Uncoyned. <hi>Five Shillings</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh Coyn</hi> weighs about an Ounce, and therefore we uſually compute an Ounce of <hi>Silver</hi> worth 5 <hi>s.</hi> becauſe 5 <hi>s.</hi> Coyned weighs an Ounce Uncoyned; ſome little differences occaſioned by the Alloy, or Charge of Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in ſome places, if ſhould be cavilled at, will not be found upon examination to be very material; and whatever Denomination hath been given to Coyned Money in any Country, to raiſe it higher than anſwers in Weight and Fineneſs to an Ounce Uncoyned, hath always been found ineffectual in all Dealings. Either Commodities will Advance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34988:13"/>ſo much in Price, or ſo much will be abated in Goodneſs, or in Weight, Length, or Breadth, or ſome way or other, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Commodity may beſt bear: For as Governments may take upon them to alter the Standard of their <hi>Coyn,</hi> ſo the People, if cannot raiſe their Goods proportionable in Price, eſpecially thoſe of Foreign Nations, will make no ſcruple to alter the Standard of their Goods; it being the Weight and Fineneſs of <hi>Coyn,</hi> that is the true Standard and Meaſure of Commerce and Dealings, and not the Denominations: Therefore great care ſhould be taken how any Alteration is made, or ſtop put to the Currency of Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Money, becauſe it will occaſion a great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and Confuſion in the carrying on of <hi>Trade. Coyn</hi> is not only the eaſieſt and ſafeſt Security that can be given, between Man and Man, but the quickeſt for Diſpatch, and of moſt Satisfaction in Buying and Selling, becauſe by the Stamp the Value is known: Bartering of Commodities for Commodities, which would follow of conſequence if there were not Money, would ſoon be found Chargable and Inconvenient, and a hindrance to <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Arguments for Raiſing of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on affirmations, that <hi>Guineas</hi> are now worth 26 <hi>s.</hi> a piece in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any of our Neighbouring Countries, will be found, upon examination, to have no Weight.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:34988:14"/>
                  <p>Common Conſent hath fixt a proportion to the Value, between <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> which will probably continue till altered by the like Common Conſent, and General Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. What may happen by Accident, or to ſerve a ſudden or extraordinary Occaſion, ought not to be put in the Ballance againſt what is the uſual courſe and practice in Dealings.</p>
                  <p>That proportion between <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> which governs here, is well known to be alſo obſerved amongſt our Neighbours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not likely ſhould act ſo contrary to their Intereſt, as to give ſuch an over-value for <hi>Guineas,</hi> as 4 or 5 <hi>s.</hi> on a <hi>Guinea,</hi> paid in our Milled Money, or any other <hi>Coyn</hi> that is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in Weight and Fineneſs, and would anſwer in Value to our Milled Money in our <hi>Mint;</hi> and therefore the Truth of the Fact may be doubted: But if it be true, we ſhould be very Impolitick, if we ſhould not incourage them to continue of that humour; for it would be our advantage to carry them all the <hi>Guineas</hi> we have, or as many as they pleaſe to take, and bring away their <hi>Silver;</hi> which for all Payments would be as uſeful to us as the <hi>Gold,</hi> and the 4 or 5 <hi>s. per Guinea,</hi> which they would, if that were true, give us, more than their Real Value, would be ſo much clear Gains.</p>
                  <p>But this Argument being too grols to hold any Conteſt, Notions about Exchange, or that <hi>Guineas</hi> will paſs in thoſe parts at that Rate, in purchaſing of Commodities, are muſtered up to make it good.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:34988:14"/>
                  <p>It hath been already aſſerted, That no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> ſhould be Exported out of any Nation to a Foreign Country, to remain and continue there, but in order to pay, or contract ſome Debt; unleſs the Perſon that Exports it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to remove himſelf alſo, or to give it away: All Perſons ſo indebted, or that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to become indebted, to any Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any Purchaſe, or Contract, conſider which way to raiſe ſuch Money, as ſhall want in that Country, whether by remitting <hi>Goods, Bills</hi> of Exchange, <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Coyn;</hi> if find that the Price of Goods, and Rate of Exchange is againſt them, and that <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Coyn</hi> will turn them better to account, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they may reſolve to ſend out <hi>Bullion,</hi> or <hi>Coyn;</hi> and the like our Neighbours, that are indebted, or have occaſion to run in Debt to us, will practice; but the Raiſing or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Coyn</hi> to prevent or further it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, or there, will have little more influence than the ſinking of a Ship in the mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> would have upon the Flux or Reflux of the <hi>Sea,</hi> becauſe the Rate of Exchange and Prices of Goods would Advance proportionable, and make it the ſame thing in effect, though may occaſion ſome Change in Names and Figures: For unleſs it can be made out, that the Raiſing or Falling of the <hi>Coyn</hi> will diſcharge what Debts we may owe to Foreign Nations, we ſhall be as lyable to pay them, after ſuch Advance, as before, and they probably as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34988:15"/>willing to be paid; which will occaſion that our <hi>Coyn</hi> muſt go, be it high or low; and nothing, but not running into Debt, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
                  <p>To imagine that Foreign Nations will in any Caſe take from us <hi>Guineas</hi> at 4 to 5 <hi>s. per</hi> piece more than are worth, compared with <hi>Silver,</hi> or in Exchange of <hi>Silver,</hi> is to imagine they will act contrary to Common Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is probable that this Aſſertion is taken up, not upon Obſervations made upon the uſual courſe of <hi>Trade,</hi> but from Accidents which may give ſome cauſe for it. As Gluts of Markets, or Want of Goods, may advance or run down their Prizes, ſo Plenty of Bills of Exchange, or Scarcity of them, or of <hi>Money</hi> for <hi>Bills,</hi> for any place, may occaſion a conſiderable alteration in their Rates on a ſudden, which may ſometimes offer Opportunities to remit <hi>Gold</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> or to any of our Neighbouring Countries, to purchaſe Bills of Exchange, which when received here may produce 26 <hi>s. per Guinea:</hi> And thus it may be ſaid that 26 <hi>s.</hi> was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for a <hi>Guinea.</hi> But the alteration of the <hi>Coyn</hi> cannot have any effect to prevent any ſuch Accidents, which as do ſometimes occaſion the carrying out of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> ſo at other times the bringing of it in: For <hi>Merchants</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi> when the Exchange gives them any ſuch temptation, ſend Money here to make the ſame Advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo. Such wayes as theſe ever were,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34988:15"/>and will be, practiced by Trading-Men to get Money, and what thus happens by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident not very material to a Nation: For when any ſuch great difference happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Product of <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Exchange,</hi> cannot according to Nature hold long; either the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Exchange</hi> will deſtroy the <hi>Trade</hi> in <hi>Bullion,</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> that by <hi>Exchange.</hi> Both <hi>Trades</hi> will not long continue, unleſs the Rates run near an Equality or Par.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Guineas</hi> be made currant by Law at 26 <hi>s.</hi> and the <hi>Silver</hi> not raiſed proportionable, then our Neighbours will take the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on us, as is before propoſed to be taken on them; bring us in <hi>Gold,</hi> and carry away our <hi>Silver,</hi> which will be ſo much Loſs to the Nation as the 4 <hi>s.</hi> or 5 <hi>s. per Guinea,</hi> on the quantity ſo brought in, will amount to: Therefore if <hi>Guineas</hi> be Advanced, our <hi>Silver Coyn</hi> muſt be Raiſed alſo.</p>
                  <p>A perpetual Silence would be put to all Arguments for Raiſing all or any of the <hi>Coyn</hi> to prevent Exportation, if the impoſſibility of preventing the Raiſing of the Rates of Exchange, and Prizes of Goods proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or how to avoid the payments of Debts to Foreigners if any ſuch be contracted, or to hinder other Princes or States from Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their <hi>Coyn</hi> proportionable, were well conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Exchange for <hi>Ireland</hi> was 10 to 15 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in Favour of that Kingdom laſt Year, now about 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in our Favour. And the like Inſtances may be given of alterations
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34988:16"/>ſince the ſtop to a Currency of the Clipt Money. In the Exchange to other places, the Price of moſt Goods did advance to the Price of <hi>Guineas,</hi> when were current at 30 <hi>s.</hi> and are ſince Fallen; which are ſuch great Proofs from Experience (and freſh in our Memory) that the Weight and Fineners of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> doth govern not only the Price of Exchange, but of Goods alſo, that it muſt afford cauſe for admiration that any doubt ſhould be made to it.</p>
                  <p>The Bulk of <hi>Trade</hi> is uſually carried on between Nation and Nation, by Bartering or Exchange of Commodities; but when diſuſe, high Cuſtoms, gluts of Markets, or any other cauſe, make ſuch alterations in the Prizes of the Commodities of any Country, that may not turn to account ſo well as <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> then <hi>Bullion</hi> will be Ship off in the room of ſuch Commodities. If for any cauſe our Goods ſhould ſo decline in Price Abroad as to hinder their being ſent out, and the Goods of ſuch Foreign Countries to which we did uſe to ſend them, ſhould continue in eſteem, and be conſumed here, then we ſhall either ſend out our <hi>Bullion</hi> to purchaſe them, or thoſe that bring them, will carry away our <hi>Bullion</hi> in return of them: But this cannot be prevented, but by taking leſs Goods from ſuch Nations, or by finding ſome way to get ſuch a Repute to our own, as that we may ſpend more there; for buying and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much of ſuch Nations, and felling and delivering little to them, muſt inevitably
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34988:16"/>bring us in Debt, and occaſion the going out of our Money to diſcharge what we did not pay in Goods. To prevent this, it is more adviſable to confider how to take away the Cauſe, that we may not run in Debt to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations, then to contrive how to pay 20 <hi>s.</hi> with 16 <hi>s.;</hi> for when we have put the beſt face we can upon the Raiſing of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> it will appear to Foreigners, like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Compoſition, to pay but a part of what we owe them inſtead of all; and be an impairing of the Credit and Publick Faith of the Nation, and occaſion ſuch Jealouſies in all the Trading People we deal with, that it may Reaſonably be expected, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bills of Exchange, and Contracts, will be ſo made, as that thoſe which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them may fence or ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the like, to prevent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Loſſes by it. We may by Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Coyn</hi> put ſome Difficulties upon ſuch Strangers to whom we are now indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not comparable to what we ſhall bring upon our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The chief uſe of <hi>Coyn,</hi> is to be a Pledge, Rule and Meaſure in Dealings, therefore ought to be Certain, Fixt and Immoveable. If one Alteration be made will create not only a Jealouſie, but a Neceſſity that more will follow, as alwayes in the like Caſe hath been practiced in all Countries. To prevent Loſſes by it, ſuch Care and Circumſpection will be required, and ſuch Endeavours will be uſed by others to make Advantages by it,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34988:17"/>in their Dealings, that the <hi>Coyn</hi> will no longer be a ſtanding Rule and Meaſure for Commerce, but be as uncertain in Value as other Commodities, and be rather a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to Trade in, then a conveniency for the carrying on of <hi>Trade:</hi> And when the continual Loſs and Confuſion, which will be the conſequence of Raiſing the <hi>Coyn,</hi> ſhall be univerſally perceived, or felt, if produce reſolutions for falling it again, as may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected in ſome ſhort time, the Difficulties how to do it will be ſo great, and the Loſs (if ſunk to the Old Rate) ſo immenſe, that it will be hard to be born. Thoſe which have had any Advantage by the Raiſing of it, will keep what they have got, and leave the Loſs that muſt happen by the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, either on the Publick, or on ſuch Particular Perſons as may then have it in their poſſeſſion. Poor and Rich will in ſuch caſe be forced to loſe One Fifth of what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they may then have, though did not get any thing by the Advance of it.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34988:17"/>Mans Pocket, but it muſt come out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or out of the Publick; as certain as it hath been found by Experience, that the Gains ſome Ill Men have made by Clipping, muſt now be paid by the Publick, or loſt by Particular Perſons, ſo Clipping it by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would be found at laſt to have the ſame effect. Thoſe that have any Money owing upon Mortgages, Bonds, Specialties, or otherwayes, muſt then receive 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> inſtead of 400, which muſt be called and taken as 100 <hi>l.</hi> which no doubt may be Lent out again, or Paid away in all Caſes as 100 <hi>l.</hi> becauſe the Law obligeth all Perſons ſo to take it; but it is not likely the Law will oblige all Perſons to ſell as much Land or Goods for ſuch 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> when muſt be eſteemed 100 <hi>l.,</hi> as was ſold for 400 before, but leave all Perſons in that to their liberty; If ſo, then it is probable the genious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Fancy of People, as well as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, will lead them to ſtand upon their Terms in all Sales, that may not take 320 inſtead of 400, notwithſtanding Arguments that it will paſs for ſo much from one to another; neither will Perſons be forward to borrow at that Rate, without aſſurance that ſhall at the ſame Rate pay it again.</p>
                  <p>The fallacy of the Argument that it will paſs ſo, and therefore no prejudice, will ſoon appear, and have little influence after a while; for People will in time conſider, what they may have in Barter for their Money, the Weight, Goodneſs, and Value of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34988:18"/>with what they bought formerly, what they can purchaſe for it, as well as how it will paſs; and if find, as ſoon will, that their 320 <hi>Crowns,</hi> though now called 100 <hi>l.,</hi> will buy no more Goods than 400 <hi>Crowns</hi> before ſuch Advance, will conclude that have miſreckoned, or are abuſed, 80 <hi>Crowns</hi> in 400: For though all People have not the ſenſe of ſeeing, yet all have the ſenſe of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In Bills of Exchange, buying of <hi>Plate,</hi> or any thing of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> will find it immediately; and in a ſhort time probably upon all Goods of our own Growth, as well as from Abroad; for the alteration that muſt happen in paſſing Bills of Exchange, muſt occaſion the Raiſing the Prizes of Foreign Goods; for few Perſons but agree, that Foreigners in their Dealings will not have reſpect to the Raiſing of our <hi>Coyn;</hi> and if their Goods ſhould Riſe and ours not, we ſhould make but a bad Bargain; for then it would inevitably follow, that we ſhould buy from Strangers their Goods 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> dearer than we ſhall ſell them: For if our Goods do not Riſe proportionable to the <hi>Coyn,</hi> then what we ſold formerly for 400 <hi>Crowns,</hi> muſt be ſold for 320, and ſo at one blow cut off One Fifth of the Value of all Goods now made or to be made, ſold to Strangers; and thereby enable them to buy here ſo cheap, as to underſell Abroad our own <hi>Merchants,</hi> and then get no more by Advancing our <hi>Coyn,</hi> then we got lately by the Strangers Importing <hi>Guineas</hi> upon us at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34988:18"/>30 <hi>s.</hi> before our Goods roſe proportionable. Either this muſt be owned, or that all Goods will Riſe in proportion; and then it may appear the greateſt Myſtery referring to <hi>Coyn,</hi> where the Advantage will be; for cannot prove a multiplication of the <hi>Coyn</hi> in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though may in Number, which will be found of little uſe, and cannot hinder the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> and if Goods Riſe, not be the occaſion of bringing it in; and if our Goods do not Riſe in proportion, then have a worſe effect: For <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> may be bought too dear; and if brought in upon ſuch loſing Terms, it will be impoſſible to keep it long here; for the very taking it upon thoſe Terms will open a door for the carrying it out again.</p>
                  <p>If a Law ſhould be made that every half Acre of Land ſhould for the future be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called an Acre, it may double the Lands in number of Acres; for thoſe Fields which were eſteemed at 100 Acres before, will then be accounted as 200 Acres, and as 200 Acres, may deſcend to the next Heir, Sold to a Purchaſer, or Lett to a Tenant; but not likely that therefore the Purchaſer or Tenant will double his Price or Rent, but will conclude that it will not bear more Graſs or Corn for the Acres being ſo doubled in Name: Not likely that the Raiſing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, either 25 or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſhould have any other effect. A <hi>Crown</hi> piece in ſuch caſe would pafs from one to another at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> where the Receiver is no more concerned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34988:19"/>than to take it by that Name. A Man that is to borrow 100 <hi>l.,</hi> will and muſt take 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> as 100 <hi>l.</hi> and not regret it; becauſe by the ſame Law will expect to pay it back at the ſame rate: But a Man that is to paſs away Lands, or Goods, for it, will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if any ſort of Goods which he may want be Riſen that he muſt be a Loſer, unleſs Raiſe his Lands and Goods, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſell, in proportion.</p>
                  <p>Borrowing and Lending, and in ſome Caſes Buying and Selling, may be properly ſaid to be the way and means to get Riches, but not the end deſigned by Mens Labours. No Man would take any pains and care of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor improve Lands or Rents, but in hopes of Gains to ſupport his Expences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the port may live in; or provide for his Family higher or lower, as may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be inabled. However Money ſo Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced may paſs for the way and means, when comes to that which is the deſign, and end, of the Labours of Men, will ſoon find the miſtake, and that 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, will go no further than 400 <hi>Crowns</hi> did before, and the like in Childrens Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or making proviſion for them; and it is the end, and not the way, that ſhould be chiefly minded in this caſe. And the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage will be found in all Expences for the Publick; and Gentlemen that have their dependance on Rents will find One Fifth loſt, either for along time, or for ever, and loſe One Fifth part of all Debts owing to them;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34988:19"/>muſt receive for 100 <hi>l.,</hi> 320 <hi>Crowns</hi> inſtead of 400 <hi>Crowns,</hi> which unleſs for payment of Debts contracted before, will ſoon find, will loſe 80 <hi>Crowns</hi> in 400. And although it may be argued, that the Rents of Lands may alſo Advance in time, yet not having ſo immediate a dependance on <hi>Trade,</hi> as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> that are bought and ſold dayly, it may be feared, that the Rents of Land will be the laſt thing that will Advance, and Old Rents, Rent Charges or Annuities, never, unleſs a Law be made for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to apprehend, why it ſhould be thought ſo eaſie to make Money (which is of ſo great Concern, and upon which moſt fix their chiefeſt Conſiderations) paſs and ſerve as the Standard of all Dealings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, according to its Name, without any reſpect to Weight or intrinſick Value, and at the ſame time probably not allow, that it is poſſible to make Land, or any ſort of Goods, to paſs by Name, without reſpect to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Value or Weight: It being not likely, that if by Law Three Fourths of an Acre of <hi>Land</hi> ſhould be called an Acre, or Three Fourths of a Pound of <hi>Lead,</hi> called a Pound, that then it would Exchange for as much <hi>Silver</hi> as before; ſo as unlikely, that when Three Fourths of a <hi>Crown</hi> piece is called a <hi>Crown,</hi> ſhould Exchange for as much <hi>Land,</hi> or <hi>Lead,</hi> as before. That ſome Credulous Perſons ſhould be impoſed upon to think well of Raiſing the <hi>Coyn</hi> not ſtrange; but if a whole Nation, it would in time be concluded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34988:20"/>they were either under an infatuation, or that they deſigned to live only for Six Months or a Year.</p>
                  <p>That Exchanges and Goods did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Riſe upon the Clipping of the Money, was becauſe there was more Unclipt than Clipt, and the Major over-ruled the Minor; but as ſoon as the Clipt exceeded the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipt, then that illegal debaſing of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> ſoon had that effect: What then can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected if ſhould be advanced or debaſed (for may be termed either) by Authority.</p>
                  <p>If the giving of <hi>Coyn</hi> high Denominations could make it paſs accordingly, and have the effect of preventing Exportation, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Importation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> how eaſie for Poor Princes to make themſelves Rich: But as it appears impoſſible that any ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſhould be made by others, ſo that ſhould long continue to us, if any could be expected, unleſs we could Enact at the ſame time, that no other Prince or State ſhould Raiſe their <hi>Coyn</hi> in proportion, which it is probable they ſoon would, if found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves prejudiced by our drawing away their <hi>Coyn</hi> by any ſuch Law here: Then the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages deſigned would be deſeated, but the Miſchiefs would remain.</p>
                  <p>Arguments for the Advancing of the <hi>Coyn</hi> deduced from the Price of <hi>Bullion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Price of <hi>Bullion.</hi>
                     </note> that it is worth much more than when Coyned, either here or in Foreign Countries, if duely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, can have no foundation. <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Coyn</hi> when Exchanged or Bartered for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34988:20"/>or the Commodities may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed higher or lower according to the Plenty or Scarcity of <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Coyn,</hi> or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but that <hi>Bullion</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> in Barter of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> of the ſame Fineneſs, can be, or ever was, worth any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more than <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> of the ſame Fineneſs, that is, an Ounce for an Ounce, cannot be from any Natural Cauſe, only by Accident, and therefore no Argument for the Advancing of <hi>Coyn:</hi> For the ſame Accidents may probably remain, though the <hi>Coyn</hi> be never ſo much Advanced.</p>
                  <p>Where there are Laws that allow of the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> but prohibit the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Coyn,</hi> as now with us, when great Quantities of <hi>Bullion</hi> do not come from Foreign Parts to exceed the occaſion of thoſe that ſend it out, to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or any other Country, where the carrying on of <hi>Trade,</hi> or payment of Debts, requires it, <hi>Bullion</hi> will not be carried to the <hi>Mint</hi> to be Coyned, but be ſold without, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of thoſe Traders that have occaſion, who will give for it much above the Rate of <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe may Ship it off with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And needing great Quantities to be Shipt ſometimes in one bottom, are loath to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Shipping of <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe if a Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, may prove a Loſs irreparable: But this may be obſerved, that when we had plenty of Milled <hi>Money</hi> and Weighty <hi>Coyn,</hi> then <hi>Bullion</hi> ſeldom exceeded the Value of <hi>Coyn</hi> 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Ounce; ſince that is grown ſcarce, the Price much Advanced.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34988:21"/>
                  <p>In <hi>Spain,</hi> when pieces of <hi>Eights</hi> are grown ſcarce at the end of a Year before the Galloons or Fleets arrive, or upon any delay or loſs of their Fleets, then oftentimes are worth 8 to 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Exchange more than at other times; but here, and there, and in all places, occaſioned by ſuch Laws or Accidents, which the Raiſing of <hi>Coyn</hi> cannot poſſibly prevent: It being as contrary to all Reaſon that an Ounce of <hi>Silver</hi> Coyned, ſhould not be worth an Ounce Uncoyned, a little more or leſs, if it were not for ſuch Accidents, as that a <hi>Shilling</hi> ſhould not be worth another <hi>Shilling</hi> of the ſame Weight and Fineneſs.</p>
                  <p>Few or no preſidents can be given, that where any or all the <hi>Coyn</hi> of a Nation was Raiſed, that the Gains by the Advance might redound to the particular perſons that had it in their cuſtody. In <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Coyn</hi> hath been often Advanced, but alwayes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to eaſe the Government in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In <hi>Portugal</hi> was Raiſed 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> about <hi>Anno</hi> 1664, becauſe the Government could not poſſibly otherwayes get <hi>Money</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who were then entring that Kingdom with a numerous Army; for which 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> of the Advance Money was taken, and 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> allowed to the People to tempt them to bring it in. In <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Gold</hi> hath been lately Riſen ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, but for the Profit of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in all theſe places, though did ſerve for a turn, yet hath occaſioned ſo much Confuſion, Complaints and Diſadvantages,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34988:21"/>that no Arguments can be drawn from thoſe Preſidents to incourage others to do the ſame. In all Ages hath been looked upon as a great diſcovery of Poverty, and like adventuring the laſt Stake. But Arguments from Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and Self-preſervation, if the Advance-Money be applyed for that end, may make ſome Excuſe, when no other way can be found to ſave a Nation.</p>

                     <hi>Silver Coyn</hi> is the Standard in all Nations. <hi>Gold,</hi> though alſo eſteemed Treaſure, and of greater Value than <hi>Silver,</hi> becauſe of its Scarcity, Durableneſs, Beauty and Uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other Metals, takes its Computation from <hi>Silver</hi> the only Standard, and is uſually reckoned by the general Conſent of Mankind, to be worth about Fifteen to One; One Ounce of <hi>Gold</hi> being uſually eſteemed worth Fifteen Ounces of <hi>Silver,</hi> is alſo neceſſary to increaſe the Treaſure, as well as Stock of the Nation, ſhould be Coyned exactly in proportion to <hi>Silver,</hi> to anſwer the Value put on it by Common Eſteem, otherwayes will give an opportunity to Foreigners, either to carry away the <hi>Gold,</hi> and bring <hi>Silver,</hi> or carry away the <hi>Silver,</hi> and bring <hi>Gold,</hi> as may turn them beſt to account. But becauſe a great Value of <hi>Gold</hi> may be preſerved in little room, and therefore with more ſecurity than <hi>Silver,</hi> impoſſible to keep it from being attended with ſome little variations, as ſuch Conveniencies may occaſion, which thoſe that have it will take the advantage to make. But <hi>Gold</hi> is not ſo ſerviceable to a Nation as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34988:22"/>
                     <hi>Silver,</hi> becauſe thoſe that have it are not willing to make Payments with it, but apt to hoard it, unleſs can have more for it than 'tis worth; which makes it rather a Commodity to Trade in, than a conveniency for the carrying on of <hi>Trade;</hi> and a part of the dead Stock of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>If the Gains expected by ſome that have the <hi>Coyn</hi> now in their cuſtody, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a combination to hoard it up, in hopes to put a force upon the Government to get it Raiſed, though may prove a great hindrance to Publick Affairs, and Commerce for ſome time; yet no remedy can be ſo bad to cure any ſuch evil, as the Raiſing of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> not only in reſpect of the great Loſs and Charge that would attend it, as becauſe would be a great incouragement to others, in a ſhort time, to hoard it up again, in hopes to force the Government to another Advance: If not, the doing it once, if extended to Debts then owing, will make ſuch a violation upon all Contracts, between Man and Man, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſuch a confuſion in our <hi>Coyn,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, Prices of Commodities, and all Dealings, that what hath been done already, to regulate the <hi>Coyn,</hi> would prove ſo much Labour loſt, and put us back ward inſtead of forward; for the Species of both <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> muſt be Raiſed, not one without the other, which would add to the Loſs, Charge, and Miſchiefs, the Clippers have brought on us already, as much more as the <hi>Coyn</hi> may be Riſen; therefore it may probably be much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34988:22"/>eaſier and ſafer, ſeeing the lighteſt of the Clipt Money is taken in, and moſt new Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to go on reforming the reſt of the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered Money, by allowing a Reaſonable Price, to incourage Perſons to bring it into the <hi>Mint,</hi> in other places as well as <hi>London,</hi> that the Countries may alſo be furniſhed with New Money, by the New Coyning of it; and when the Rate is fixt. for the taking it in to be Coyned, if be alſo taken in upon Funds, and by the Receivers of the Publick Revenue, may probably then paſs from hand to hand, at the ſame Rate by Weight, for the carrying on of Commerce, till can be taken in, and New Coyned, which ſhould be with all ſpeed, that our ſeveral Species of <hi>Coyn</hi> may be reduced to one Standard which is abſolutely neceſſary. The Raiſing of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> inſtead of conquering this over-grown Monſter, which hath ſo much endangered the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nation, will create a new brood of Miſchiefs more ravenous than the Dam, and be rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, than abated, by limiting ſuch an Advance to continue but for a ſhort time, or to be allowed only during this preſent War. A Law ſo limited will occaſion that ſome part of the <hi>Coyn</hi> may change hands, with great Gains to all Tenants and Debtors, but what they get the Landlords and Creditors muſt loſe; but ſo far from affording the leaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a general Currency to our <hi>Coyn,</hi> or any Advantage to the Publick, that the quite contrary effect may be feared; for all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34988:23"/>(excepting thoſe indebted) will then find it difficult, if not impoſſible to make any uſe of the <hi>Coyn</hi> ſo Raiſed: If offer to lend it out upon Bonds or Mortgages, thoſe that receive it at 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.,</hi> if have a proſpect, fear or jealouſie, that the <hi>Crown</hi> will in time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again to 5 <hi>s.</hi> muſt be out of their Wits, if do not agree that he that lends it, ſhall receive the <hi>Crown</hi> at the ſame rate again of 6 <hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> when they pay it back; and if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to lay it out in Lands, Goods, or Bills of Exchange, will find the like caution will be taken; if lent it into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the like care be not taken there to agree to pay back at the ſame rate they receive it, then the Lender may be ſafe, by the Kings bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loſs, and upon ſuch Terms no doubt will prove a temptation for the bringing in of great Sums upon Loans: But if the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> ſhould take care to prevent any ſuch Loſs, and pay what they may then owe, with Money ſo Advanced, the Loſs the People may receive thereby will prove a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the bringing in of more Money; And thoſe that have received 40000 <hi>Crowns</hi> for 50000, inſtead of paying it into the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> may be under as great temptations to hoard it up, in expectation to force ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Change in their favour (having juſtice to plead in their behalf, that they may not be loſers) as thoſe that contrived the Raiſing of it before it was paid to them; the hopes thereof, and the interruptions that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in the Paying of Bills of Exchange,

As the Legiſlative Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is undoubted, ſo their Judiciary hath been often practiced upon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; if a ſtricter proſecution in order to Condemnation, or of ſeverer Chaſtiſements upon ſuch as may be found with any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Coyning of Falſe Money, or with any quantities of ſuch Money, unleſs can prove where they received it, and for the cutting in pieces of ſuch Money by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Juſtices when offered in payment, and for frequent Proclamations upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any Falſe Coyn, with deſcriptions and directions how may be known, by Weighing or other wayes, which may be had by the help of the Officers of the <hi>Mint,</hi> that the Magiſtrates and Juſtices may do their Duty in cutting and defacing ſuch <hi>Coyn,</hi> which will keep the people upon a conſtant guard to diſcover it. If ſuch Powers as may be thought neceſſary for theſe ends, to put a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34988:25"/>ſtop to this growing Evil, ſhould not be thought convenient to be intruſted with infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Courts, as may without danger be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and executed by the High Court of Parliament, ſo if ſhould in ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Caſes be ſo reſerved, moſt likely to ſtrike the greateſt terrour into ſuch Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they may no longer be incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to go on, by depending upon the favour of Juries, niceties of Law, or hopes of Pardons.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe foregoing Conſiderations it may appear,<note place="margin">The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of looking into <hi>Trade.</hi>
                     </note> that the true Reaſon for the Exportation of our <hi>Coyn</hi> is running in Debt to Foreign Nations, and that the Raiſing of our <hi>Coyn,</hi> or Laws againſt the Exportation of it, or <hi>Bullion,</hi> can have little or no effect towards the increaſing or retaining of it, and that it can only be done by looking into <hi>Trade,</hi> and all other Tranſactions, upon which the contracting of Debts with Foreign Nations depends, and by making ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations and Reformations, as may reduce the Ballance of Accompts with Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be in our favour.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34988:25"/>own, will be under a great diſadvantage; for like good or bad Husbandry in other Caſes, that will have a great influence upon the increaſe or decreaſe of Riches. Thoſe that are prodigal in the conſumption of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities, do by that prodigality bring the Nation in Debt more than neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as much as they might have ſaved to themſelves in their own Expences; and thoſe that are prodigal in the expence of their own Products, do decreaſe the Exportation of ſo much as they might have ſaved: Therefore though it may be true, that bad Husbands and Prodigal Perſons do, by ſuch Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, promote <hi>Trade,</hi> it can only be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood for the advantage of our Home <hi>Trades,</hi> but not for the inriching of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>However much doth depend upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of our Home <hi>Trades;</hi> vaſt numbers of People have their Livelyhoods from it, and the Grandeur, Strength and Wealth of great Cities and Corporations are chiefly ſupported by it.

The more are maintained by Laborious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <hi>Trades,</hi> the Richer the Nation will be both in People and Stock, and thereby all have the conveniency of Commodities the cheaper: Therefore all Laws, By-Laws, and Cuſtoms of Corporations, that tend to Reſtrain, Limit, and Narrow our beneficial
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34988:26"/>Home <hi>Trades,</hi> may upon examination be found prejudicial to the Publick.</p>
                  <p>Building Ships, and the great Dealings which are neceſſary for the Manufacturing of all Goods to be made fit for Exportation, and for the Conſumption of what brought from Abroad, may be eſteemed as part of our Domeſtick <hi>Trade:</hi> So that although the Riches of the Nation cannot be ſaid to be immediately from our Domeſtick <hi>Trades,</hi> yet it is that upon which our Foreign <hi>Trade,</hi> and conſequently our Riches, have ſo great dependance, that there cannot be one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, in any great meaſure; and the Landed Men, and ſuch others as have Wealth, but not ingaged in <hi>Trade,</hi> give their help alſo, either by affording Materials, or as Conſumers, of what made here, or brought from Abroad, the Merchants by Exporting and Importing, the Seamen by carrying; and thus the whole Body of the Nation may be ſaid to help, and be uſeful, in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of <hi>Trade,</hi> which if well conſidered would prevent all Animoſities and Enmity between the ſeveral Callings: Their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is ſo intermixt, that neither could thrive without the help one of the other.</p>
                  <p>The way to make our Domeſtick <hi>Trade</hi> more ſubſervient to us,<note place="margin">To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Lands and Rent.</note> would be to give all incouragement to the increaſe of all ſorts of Manufacturies, and Handicrafts <hi>Trades;</hi> for that may occaſion a multiplication of People, and of Profitable Imployments, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our Exportation, and decreaſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34988:26"/>our Importation: For the more variety we have of Goods of our own make, the leſs we ſhall need from Abroad, and have the more to Export. And this would alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Improvement of Lands, and their Advancement, both in Rent and Value, not only becauſe <hi>Wooll, Flax,</hi> and ſome other of our own Products may be ſpent in the Manufacturing of ſuch Commodities, and if People increaſe we ſhould have a greater Conſumption, but becauſe it is the ſureſt way to lay a foundation for the increaſing of Riches, and the <hi>Coyn</hi> of the Nation, which above all other Cauſes that can be aſſigned will be the moſt effectual to advance Lands and Rents. Plenty of Money will alwayes produce variety and plenty of Chapmen to purchaſe, or take Lands at Annual Rents, and cauſe the Products to advance in Price; but ſcarcity of <hi>Coyn</hi> will alwayes have the contrary effect: And it is not likely that any other way can be found out to advance the Value of Lands that will be general, or hold for any long time.</p>
                  <p>Our moveable Riches had their Original,<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Riches</note> and muſt have their Increaſe from the Labour and Induſtry of our People, by digging out of the Bowels of the Earth, Manufacturing and making fit for uſe the Product thereof; and <hi>Fiſh</hi> got out of the Sea, and Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to, and Trading with Foreign Nations; or by <hi>Trades</hi> carried on by Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ſold to Foreign Nations; or by Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given to our Shipping Abroad. All
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34988:27"/>which depends upon having many people: Therefore the obtaining more, and well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying thoſe we have, may deſerve conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>Though in all Nations there ever were ſeveral Conditions,<note place="margin">From the Labour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> Qualities and Degrees of Men, yet it cannot be too often conſider'd, that though a Gentleman have Lands valued in 10 or 20000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and Mines of <hi>Gold</hi> at his own diſpoſe; <hi>Divines, Lawyers, Phyſicians, &amp;c.</hi> never ſo great Merits, Parts, or pretences to Gains or Incomes, yet would be ſo far from inriching the Nation, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Riches or Plenty themſelves, that they would not have Neceſſaries, nor Money to buy them, without the help of the labouring and working Men; that all perſons may in their ſeveral ſtations endeavour to promote Induſtry, as the foundation of Riches, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their own Welfare.</p>
                  <p>When thoſe that depend to have their Riches and Neceſſaries from the Sweat and Labour of others, are more in proportion than thoſe that labour to provide thoſe things that are neceſſary to ſupply them, there muſt be a danger that the Riches of the Nation muſt be conſumed, and that Scarcity and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty will enſue.</p>
                  <p>It is not doubted,<note place="margin">To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> but there is a labour of the Brain as well as of the Body, that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, which cannot ſubſiſt without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well for Dominion, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Property and Liberty, without
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34988:27"/>which there would be no incouragement to Induſtry; and that many ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the labour of the Body, not only becauſe have great Eſtates and Dignities, but becauſe may apply themſelves wholly to the labour of the Brain, for the carrying on the Governing part, that Religion may be promoted, Peace preſerved, Juſtice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd, the Publick ſecured, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences defrayed; but when more are bred up, or admitted, for the carrying on of ſuch Imployments than are neceſſary, eſpecially of the meaner ſort, will be attended with ill conſequences by defrauding the Publick of ſo many hands which would be more uſeful in the Mines, or at Husbandry, or in the Fiſhing Trade or Manufacturies.</p>
                  <p>It is obvious that of late, no Imployment offers in Church or State, nor in any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Family, that can be performed without Bodily Labour, but pretenders too it are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, though the Imployment be mean; but for Plowing, or any ſort of Husbandry, digging in our Mines, or working on Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies, or any ſervile work in Families, or any thing that requires Labour, Servants are difficult to be got, as is experienced in moſt parts of the Kingdom; which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that the generality do bring up their Children either idly, or give them ſuch Education as inclines them to Imployments not accompanied with Labour; or that the People are too much run off from thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Imployments that are moſt neceſſary for the Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34988:28"/>
                  <p>Too many being ingaged in ſuch Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more than are neceſſary, and more that ſpend their days idly in hopes to get them, is a great load upon the Nation; as well becauſe their hands are wanted to carry on Husbandry and Trade, as becauſe are of ill Example to others: And when ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments fail, being diſuſed and enemies to Labour, fall to Robbing, Stealing, Pilfering, Clipping, or the like, to get a Livelyhood; and think it a ſufficient Excuſe to ſay, when come to ſuffer for it, <hi>That they could not other wayes live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe that ſpend their Time in Imployments unprofitable to the Publick, or in Addreſſes, and expectation to get them, many that are able to work rather chooſe to live by Begging, both in City and Country, and a great number Idle upon ſeveral other pretences, induſtrious in nothing but how to avoid Work: Such ſhould not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the obligations and injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Charity, leaſt the Stock of the Nation, which depends on Labour, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all muſt live, ſhould by incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch Idle Drones and Vagrants, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>If the Labour of every Working Man may be eſteemed at 5 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Gains to the Nation, it amounts to a vaſt Sum that is loſt Annually by the Idleneſs of ſo many people, and ſuch Idle Imployments. The want of ſuch hands, as it hath made Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſcarce for Labour, ſo it hath advanced
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34988:28"/>their Wages, which doth fall heavy upon <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> and the advance of Wages hath proved an inducement to Idleneſs; for many are for being Idle the oftner, becauſe they can get much in a little time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little the better for it.</p>
                  <p>It may poſſibly appear upon examination that this Miſchief has riſen from the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children; Pariſhes and Parents hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been very negligent of late Years to put the Poor out to Labour, or any Imployment, in their Minority, and being bred up Idly in their Youth, cannot afterwards bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor be brought to work; eſpecially if they have learnt to get any thing for their Subſiſtance, by any pilfering or Finical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                  <p>How much the breeding up the Children of poor people to Learning or Scholarſhip hath conduced to their avoiding of Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imployes may be conſidered; for few that have once learnt to Write and Read, but either their Parents, or themſelves, are apt to think that they are fit for ſome preferment, and in order to it, deſpiſe all Labouring Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and live Idle rather than diſparage themſelves by Work, and not endeavour to reap ſome particular Advantage by ſuch Learning.</p>
                  <p>As Communities conſiſt of ſeveral degrees, ſo it is convenient that every degree ſhould be preſerved. Though Learning is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and prefered, yet there being many indications of undoubted Authority, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34988:29"/>Man ſhould live by Labour; and in the Swear of his Face eat his Bread: If Learning, and Labour of the Body be now found inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, or not to be expected in one perſon, and the Nation like thereby to want what is neceſſary, for ſecurity againſt the common dangers of Famine and Poverty, whether ſhould be let alone that people may take their own way, in the Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſome Remedy ſhould be applyed, being a tender point, is left to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But as we have Free-Schools to teach Children to Write and Read, if we had alſo as many Publick-Workhouſes, to teach them to Spin and Card, and manufacture Goods, would probably prove advantageous to ſuch Children, and Nation alſo.</p>
                  <p>How the Education of the Rich is changed of late Years, may be fitter for private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations than to be particularly expoſed; but if thoſe of great Qualities, and Eſtates, would breed up Sons and Daughters to ſome neceſſary Buſineſs and Imployment, after they have obtained a ſtock of Learning, as might prove a great addition to their Fortunes, and happy Living, ſo of advantage to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Time ſpent in Buſineſs would be more Honourable to the Greateſt, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God and Man, than ſpending it in Revellings and Vanity, as it is feared is too much practiced. Thoſe that can give a good account to the Publick how they ſpend their time, are likely to give the beſt account hereafter, at the Great Day.</p>

                  <p>The Seventh day was appointed for Gods Service, and for Man to reſt from his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; whether the many Holydayes kept now be not a great load upon the Nation, may be Conſider'd; for if but 2 Millions of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People at 6 <hi>d. per</hi> day, comes to 50000 <hi>l.</hi> which upon a due inquiry from whence our Riches muſt ariſe, will appear to be ſo much Loſt to the Nation, by every Holyday that is kept, whether ſome may not be aboliſht, eſpecially being what was deſigned by thoſe Holydayes is remember'd only by ſome few, the Major part, ſpending ſuch dayes in Idleneſs, if not Debauchery: But at the ſame time that care is taken to force, or intice the People to Work; ſo care ſhould be taken there ſhould be Imployment enough for them, for which the incouraging by Example, as well as Laws, the Expence of our Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Commodities, and the encouraging of the <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Linnen, Paper</hi> and other Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures among us, ſuch as upon examination may be found moſt Convenient, would be of great Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Propoſals for Setting the Poor at Work have been ſo often made Publick, and ſome of them ſo well contrived, and deſigned, that little can be added, and therefore it may be lamented have not had the Sanction of Law to make them effectual; and that thoſe Laws we have againſt Idleneſs, Debaucheries, and for the Imploying of the Poor have not been better Executed; there having been a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remiſneſs in Magiſtrates and others:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34988:30"/>therefore not ſtrange we ſhould feel the ill Conſequence of it, and wiſh for a better Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Some have obſerved that the Taxes to the Poor on Lands, and Pariſhes, are increaſed to be double what they were 20 Years ſince; which if true is a great proof that many more have now a Recourſe to that Idle way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maintained then formerly; and half the Mony Imployed to put them to Work, would enable them to Live more Comfortable, and be more uſeful to the Publick.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Propoſitions cannot appear trivial if it be Conſider'd that the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> which many Years held the Ballance of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> notwithſtanding her great extents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Scituation, and rich Mines in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> by permitting ſo great numbers of her People of both Sexes, to enter into Religious Orders, the reſt to Live in grave Idleneſs, keeping many Holydayes, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little Work, hath declined to ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that of the ſtrongeſt and richeſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy in <hi>Europe,</hi> is become one of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and to be Supported by the Labour of their <hi>Blacks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> that dig their <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> for them out of their Mines: And it may be preſumed that it will be impoſſible for that Monarchy to Recover it Self, without uſing better Politicks to increaſe her People, and make them uſeful. Thoſe that went to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> could not be the true Cauſe of her Declining, becauſe as the People are managed, would have been of little uſe, if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34988:30"/>had ſtaid in the Country, it being not the way to grow Rich to have many Eaters, and few Workers.</p>
                  <p>If ſomething be not done for the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual breeding up of young Children, to ſuch Imployments as may Enure them to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and Induſtry, in their younger days, and for the Lopping off, or preventing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of ſuch a number upon Maintainance from the Pariſh, and Idle Imployments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the Nation, it may be feared we ſhall grow top-heavy, and be in as much danger of falling, as a Tree that hath many branches but little Root, though there may be ſome hopes of a remedy from the Courſe and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things; becauſe as Riches, and Plenty, produce Luxury, and Idleneſs, ſo neceſſity, and Poverty may produce Induſtry, and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality: Yet wiſe Nations do not uſually let things run to the laſt extremity, if can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevent it; and the danger may appear too great to be adventured, if well Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Acts for a General Naturalization,<note place="margin">General Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation.</note> though not abſolutely neceſſary, yet would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in order to increaſe people, have been often attempted, and as often laid aſide, without coming to perfection, yet at the ſame time ſeldom refuſed to particular Perſons; which is to grant it, when the Perſons are of qualities to pay for it, (for it is attended with a conſiderable Charge) but to deny it <hi>Gratis;</hi> and thereby the Working People, who we moſt want, are ſhut out from the benefit of it;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34988:31"/>though any that come and bring their Eſtates with them ought to be welcome. The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Poor might probably tend more to the encreaſe of Riches then what can be expected by admitting the Rich; for theſe may ſo far exceed the Rich in number, that if kept to Imployments, might in time get more, then may probably be brought by the few Rich that may come in: Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, eſpecially the Trading Part, are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently againſt ſuch an Act, on a miſtaken Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that the Strangers will then take the bread out of their Mouths: The Shoomaker ſuppoſeth if there come a Shoomaker, and make Shooes, that he ſhall Sell the leſs, not Conſidering that as there may come one Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, ſo there may come many others, who muſt all need Shooes, but not Make them, and increaſe the expence of Shooes, more then he can well fear the new Shoomaker can Make. The like with all other Trades. And therefore if underſtood their Intereſt, would not find Reaſon to be againſt it, unleſs could Imagine that all came in would take to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Trade, then might bring down the Price, or over-load that particular Trade.</p>
                  <p>But the timing of ſuch an Act as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to abroad, as at home, is Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; when the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants were firſt Baniſhed, or made Fly from <hi>France,</hi> was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuned and the next thing, to make ſuch an Act advantageous, would be to take care to Imploy the People that may come, in ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Trades, then we might have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34988:31"/>of gaining by it. Many People in a ſhort time, which otherways will be long growing up, but if ſhould come and live Idle, would do us more hurt then good.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that may be inclined to Husbandry, to Incloſing, Dreyning, Dreſſing, or otherways Improving Lands, when can be ſpared from the plow or other Imployments, abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; others to Spinning, Weaving, or any Imployment relating to any Sort of our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures that we have or may think good to Promote: and ſo we may make Proviſion for the Imployments of Multitudes of both Sexes, and all Ages, from Seven years Old upwards, for all Seaſons and times of the Year; where ſeveral Sorts of Manufactures are made, not likely all will fail, and ſuch as are inclined to the Sea, may be Imployed in the Fiſhing Trades</p>

                  <p>And as the goodneſs of Commodities is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to introduce, incourage, or preſerve the Conſumption of them, ſo is the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34988:32"/>price. Few perſons either abroad, or at home, are ſo bad Husbands, as not to endeavour to have the moſt for their Mony. If other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can afford the ſame, or other Goods, that may Serve for the ſame uſes Cheaper, then we can, ſuch will be ſpent, and ours will lye by the Walls; therefore all Charges, Cuſtoms, and Duties, on our own products and Manufactures, and on our own Shipping, may appear to be Impolitick and Miſchievous, and be convenient to be taken off, if ſome other Duties leſs prejudicial, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in the room of them for a recompence. The like prejudice may ariſe from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Wages, and Materials; therefore the ſafeſt way for a Nation to enrich its Self is to have many People, and many Materials; for gaines made by a large <hi>Trade,</hi> may continue In ſpite of all oppoſition, but gaines made by a high price on a ſmall <hi>Trade,</hi> not like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and to the Nation much better to have the gains ariſing by <hi>Trade,</hi> divided amongſt many, then few.</p>
                  <p>Next to Manufacturing and making Goods, follows carrying to Markets, for which Cheap and eaſie Carriage, and Protection from Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by Land, and Pyrates or Enemies by Sea, is Material; without it Foreign <hi>Trade</hi> cannot be advantageous. By the Goods conſumed or Spent at home, our neceſſities for them are ſupplyed; what are not ſo Spent, are carryed to Foreign Markets, which only can increaſe Riches, but not likely without good Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſafe Conduct.</p>

                     </note> in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how the Ballance Stands in reference to <hi>Trade</hi> in General or particular, may be of great uſe to diſcover and give Light, what Trades and Commodities ought to be incouraged, and what diſcouraged.</p>
                  <p>For though great difficulties may ariſe in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting the Ballance of <hi>Trade,</hi> and impoſſible to be done, exactly, yet ſuch endeavours ſhould not be ſlighted. Where plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration cannot be had, ſuch proof as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is capable off, ſhould ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Cuſtom houſe</hi> Books there are enter'd, what Goods are Exported to or Imported from Foreign Countryes, of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould be taken for ſuch Years as may be thought convenient, and the value com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, ſuch as are brought in our own Ships according to their Coſt put aboard, ſuch as are brought in Foreign bottoms, as are worth before Cuſtom paid, for what it appears we have Imported we muſt ſtand Debtors, and for what we have Exported Creditors.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes Ships and Goods are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for one Country, that are deſigned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when the Merchant can give any good proof or Reaſon, for any ſuch Practice; for any Country if the value can be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements may be made for it out of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt Stated as before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>It may alſo be objected that where we ſtand Debtors upon any ſuch account, it doth not follow that the Ballance is Carried out of this Nation in <hi>Coyn,</hi> for it may be, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34988:33"/>by Bills of Exchange drawn from the effects remitted to <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſome other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or by Fiſh from the <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> or Goods Carried from one Foreign Country, to another, which could not be enter'd in our <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Books, and therefore not come within the Computation, as ought.</p>
                  <p>This may in ſome Caſes be true; and what Fiſh is Carryed from <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> or Goods from any place belonging to <hi>England,</hi> ought to be abated out of the Accompt ſo Stated; but <hi>Bills</hi> of Exchange or <hi>Mony</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> if it appear that would otherways have come Home to us in <hi>Bullion,</hi> is <hi>tant a mount,</hi> as if Carryed from us in <hi>Mony,</hi> and therefore ought not to be allowed. Goods Carried from one Foreign Country to another, may be allowed, as a good Reaſon for an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if are the product of our own.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that many, and the Richeſt Goods, are ſometimes Exported or Imported by Stealth; if no inquiry can reach the value of ſuch, may happily produce another good effect, to uſe the uttermoſt diligence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; but it may appear upon due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that it may not be reaſonable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of any ſuch Goods, for a Charge or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in making up ſuch an Account; for as are ſmuggled, ſo raiſe a ſuſpicion that are not Goods approved off by the Government; and probably not Convenient ſhould be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or Imported: But no General rule can be preſcribed in this or many other Caſes.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34988:33"/>
                  <p>All pretences that our <hi>Bullion</hi> is not Carried out of the Kingdom to make up the Ballance to any Country from whence we Import more than we Export, that it is drawn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Bills</hi> of Exchange, from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foreign Country, ſhould be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a great ſuſpicion, that our <hi>Trade</hi> to any ſuch Country, is not profitable; for upon an Examination, ſuch pretences may appear to be to the Nation no otherways, then with a Merchant that drives two Trades, upon making up his Accounts finds that by one of the Trades had got 2000 <hi>l.</hi> but that by the other had loſt 1000 <hi>l.</hi> though upon the whole is a Gainer, yet being the loſs by the one muſt be ſupplyed by the Gains from the other, may probably be fonder of that Trade where he got then of that by which he loſt; and that unleſs can be well aſſured by new Meaſures to make it more Beneficial, not be forward to continue any ſuch Trade. The like Rule ſhould be obſerved by Nations.</p>
                  <p>It is probable ſome other helps may be had to diſcover the Ballance of <hi>Trade,</hi> from the Rates of Exchange; by informations to what our Countries, our Coyn or <hi>Bullion,</hi> is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Carried, and by a Judgment made upon the Scituations, Policy, Cuſtoms, and Habits of ſuch Countries to which we Trade; all which though may not amount to a certain Proof, may be ſufficient to produce Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for incouraging of thoſe Trades, by which it may appear we certainly get, and for endeavours to better thoſe where a Suſpicion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34988:34"/>ariſeth that we may loſe, and to diſcourage thoſe where there appears a certainty that are pernicious.</p>
                  <p>Where the Ballance of <hi>Trade</hi> is againſt us, if we cannot alter it by increaſing the expence of our Goods there, or by Spending in the Room of theirs the like Goods taken from another Country, from whence we may have them on better Terms, then the ſafeſt way (if we can be without ſuch Goods) is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the uſe and expence of them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: If that be not likely to have any effect, then high Cuſtoms or Prohibitions may be uſed; but Prohibitions ſhould alwayes be the laſt Remedy, when no other way can be found out, becauſe may occaſion prejudicial Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially if Contrary to Treatiſe of Commerce; and if too much Practiſed may prove ſuch a Stinting of <hi>Trade,</hi> by being of ill Example to others, that we that are a Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation, ſhould be careful how uſe them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but no Trading Nation but do take that Courſe ſomeimes, and ought to be practiſed, rather then permit a loſing <hi>Trade</hi> to be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, if no other remedy.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Trades</hi> may be eſteemed good which conſume our products,<note place="margin">What <hi>Trades</hi> good.</note> and Manufactures, upon which the value of our Land and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Poor depends, that increaſe our Seamen and Navigation upon which our Strength depends, that Supply us with ſuch Commodities as we abſolutely want for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our <hi>Trade,</hi> or for our ſafety, or Carry out more then bring in, upon which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Riches depends.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34988:34"/>
                  <p>On the contrary,<note place="margin">What <hi>Trades</hi> bad.</note> thoſe that Import more than they Export, or bring us in Goods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Manufactured, or any ſort of Goods that hinder the expence of our own, or that carry out <hi>Wooll,</hi> or other Materials, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Foreign Nations to make Manufactures to be ſpent in the room of our own, or bring in Commodities that are not of neceſſary uſe, but tend to increaſe Idleneſs, and Luxurious Expences, or are carried on by Foreign Bottoms, or Factors or Merchants that are Foreigners, (not ſo advantageous as when carried on by our own Ships and People) or <hi>Trades</hi> carried on by the Exportation of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion.</hi> Such Heads as theſe may ſerve as a Touchſtone for the Examination of <hi>Trades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt <hi>Trades</hi> are carried on between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a permutation of Commodities,<note place="margin">Moſt <hi>Trades</hi> carried on by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Goods.</note> as a mutual conveniency, for the ſupplying each the other with what they want; Providence having ſo ordained that different Nations may abound with different Commodities, and to want others, which makes the Exchange commodious. Thoſe that want leaſt, and have moſt to Export (to which Induſtry ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Natural Advantages doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute) generally have the advantage; but if they ſhould take none though could live without them, the like meaſures would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be taken by other Countries.</p>
                  <p>As Millions of People in this Kingdom have no Livelyhood but what depends upon <hi>Trade,</hi> ſo great care ſhould be taken how
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34988:35"/>any ſtop is put to any branch of it, or any thing allowed that may decreaſe it: But it being poſſible that ſome Men may inrich themſelves by, and ſo conſequently be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to carry on ſome <hi>Trade</hi> that may have a quite contrary effect, as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general; where that appears plain, a ſtop may be put, having reſpect in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of this kind, to this General Rule, That Liberty of <hi>Trade</hi> is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make it Great, and Greatneſs to make it Beneficial, and to obſerve it accordingly where the foundation for <hi>Trade</hi> is good.</p>
                  <p>Many Traders upon occaſions take up Money at Intereſt;<note place="margin">Of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</note> and ſome are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the reducing of Intereſt by Law to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is the only thing neceſſary to increaſe <hi>Trade,</hi> and inrich the Nation.</p>
                  <p>It's true, Laws have been made formerly for the bringing down of Intereſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for ſetting Prices on ſome Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the Price of Intereſt hath fallen ſince, and <hi>Trade</hi> increaſed: But it may be a queſtion if it was occaſioned by thoſe Laws; it being next to impoſſible to hinder thoſe that have Money or Goods not to make the moſt ſome way or other, here or elſewhere. Therefore others are of Opinion, that the increaſe of <hi>Trade</hi> is rather the cauſe of the falling of Intereſt, than that Low Intereſt ſhould occaſion the increaſe of <hi>Trade,</hi> and that it was not occaſioned by thoſe Laws, but by our increaſe of People, Induſtry and <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:34988:35"/>
                  <p>Nations differ ſo extreamly in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Methods of Living and Dealing, that we ought to be careful how we take our Meaſures from any Foreign Nation, without due Conſideration of their ſtate, as well as our own. The <hi>Dutch, Genoueſes, Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> being well ſeated for <hi>Trade,</hi> but having not <hi>Lands</hi> of any great Value, the <hi>Lands</hi> ſell high, becauſe the Buyers are abundantly more than the Sellers; and being there are not <hi>Lands</hi> for thoſe that have got great Eſtates by <hi>Trade</hi> to purchaſe, they are under a neceſſity to continue their Eſtates in <hi>Trade,</hi> and their Children to continue the ſame after them: And therefore it may be concluded that it is the Greatneſs of their <hi>Trade</hi> that is probably the cauſe of Low In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and not that of their great <hi>Trade:</hi> But if they did not outdo us in Frugality and Parſimony, they would have little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over us by the difference of 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the price of Intereſt Money. But not Living at One Fifth of the Expence we do gives them a great advantage as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching thoſe Nations. A Man of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Eſtate not ſpending there 200 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> but here 'tis expected that of the like Eſtate they ſhould ſpend 1000 <hi>l.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have large Territories, but the People ſuch Enemies to Induſtry, that if they had Money at 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> they would never increaſe <hi>Trade,</hi> as long as they continue of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34988:36"/>
                  <p>As Gains is the Mother of <hi>Trade</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo it hath an influence on its branches, or ingredients, that are neceſſary to carry it on, of which Money is the chiefeſt; therefore it is probable that all perſons that Lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at Intereſt, who are uſually Widows, Truſtees for Orphans, or ſuch as are Aged or not Induſtrious, if they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Law to 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, if they cannot by ſome indirect way make more of it, will either hoard it up, lend it at the ſaid rate of 4 <hi>per Cent.,</hi> adventure it in <hi>Trade</hi> themſelves, lay it out in <hi>Land,</hi> or ſend it out of the Nation to be Lent out at Intereſt Abroad. How any of theſe wayes will be more for the Advantage of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then as the caſe ſtands at preſent, may be conſidered. If they hoard it up, then it will be as ſo much loſt; if Lent out at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on Mortgages, then thoſe that have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to borrow will have the Advantage, and what they ſave by it, muſt be loſt by thoſe that Lend, but no Advantage to the Nation, only a taking it out of one Mans Pocket to put it into anothers. If they Lend it to Trading Men, or adventure it in <hi>Trade</hi> themſelves, ſtill there will be but the ſame Stock as before. If they lay it out in <hi>Land,</hi> and the Price, as to ſale, ſhould advance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, then thoſe that Sell would have ſome Advantage by it, and thoſe that Buy pay the dearer, but the <hi>Lands</hi> will be ſtill the ſame as before to the Nation; and unleſs the Rent advance as well as the Value, not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34988:36"/>incourage Improvement, which cannot well be ſuppoſed will be practiced by thoſe that take up Money at Intereſt. And if they ſend it out of the Nation, though it return in time with Intereſt, yet we may ſuffer more by the want of the uſe of it at Home, then we may gain by ſuch Intereſt made Abroad.</p>
                  <p>Intereſt being abated to 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Law, is a proof that Laws are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for any ſuch purpoſe, but that it may be preſumed <hi>Trade</hi> governs <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and not <hi>Intereſt, Trade;</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be comprehended how a Change of 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more, ſhould have any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Improving or Advancing of <hi>Land,</hi> Increaſing of <hi>Trade,</hi> or enable us to outdo the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or other Nations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no great help can be expected from any ſuch Law for abatement of Intereſt, but may rather be pernicious by diſcouraging the uſe of <hi>Coyn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paper Credit may be of ſome uſe, as well for the Supply of the Publick,<note place="margin">Paper Credit.</note> as for the carrying on of Commerce, which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned that many Projects have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and ſome put in practice, for making Paper to paſs for Money, taking it to be very eaſie, and that it could not fail of a good effect, becauſe the like hath been, and is ſtill practiced in <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and ſome have gone ſo far as to aſſert, that <hi>Coyn</hi> is unneceſſary, that <hi>Paper</hi> would do as well.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34988:37"/>
                  <p>In this, as in all other Caſes relating to <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Coyn,</hi> we ſhould be careful how we take our Meaſures from Foreign Nations. The Banks of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> have, by their long Experienced Uſefulneſs, put ſuch an Obligation upon thoſe Governments to ſupport them, that thoſe Banks are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as an Eſſential part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the People thereby poſſeſt with ſo good an eſteem of them (though it is doubted if they have any conſiderable Funds) that as long as thoſe Governments ſtand, the Credit of the Banks are like to ſtand alſo; the Intereſt of the Banks being ſo interwoven with the Government, that the Publick Faith muſt be their ſupport. But this may be a Priviledge due particularly to Commonwealth Governments; and it may not be found ſo eaſie to ſet up any ſuch Banks under a Monarchy: And the Antiquity of thoſe Banks is alſo a further Security to them; and the allowing of Paper Credit there, not ſo dangerous as here.</p>
                  <p>The ſtriking of Tallies for the ſupply of the Publick hath been long practiſed here, and by Authority, but Paper Credit for the carrying on of Commerce is new, and hath been left (till of late) to take its own way, though a matter of great importance, and well worth the care of the Government; no footſteps of <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Notes paſſing for Money till ſince <hi>Anno</hi> 1650.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> is valuable in all parts, but our <hi>Paper</hi> Credit only amongſt our ſelves,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34988:37"/>and that no longer than the Funds, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, on which it is grounded ſtand good; though it is not probable, that thoſe which have once got <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> will give it away to a Foreign Nation, yet they may be under great temptations, rather than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the danger and trouble of keeping it when they cannot make any Profit by it, to accept of any Overtures for Lending, or other wayes imploying it, in a Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which may occaſion that a Nation that relyes much on Paper Credit, may be thought Rich one day, and be found Poor another. When a great War happens, which only can diſcover (like Death to ſome great Traders) whether a Nation be Rich or Poor, then the Paper Credits may fail us, and our Money too, if due incouragement be not given to increaſe and preſerve our <hi>Coyn.</hi> Such Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits, as far as may be neceſſary to ſupply the want of <hi>Coyn,</hi> may be very uſeful, but if it ſhould be practiced to joſtle out the uſe of <hi>Coyn,</hi> as ſome have propoſed, is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and may have the ſame effect with a Nation, as with a Gentleman that hath an Eſtate in <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Money:</hi> If he ſhould ſquander away his <hi>Money,</hi> on a ſuppoſition that Bills of Credit iſſued out, chargable on his <hi>Land,</hi> may do as well, he would not long be the true Owner, either of <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Paper Credits may be allowed with a proſpect that they may ſtand good againſt all attempts, or accidents, that may endanger
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34988:38"/>its Reputation; but if general and too much, the more likely to fail, and ſink under its own weight. If at the ſame time that ſuch great endeavours are uſed to ſet up ſo many ſorts of Credits, there be not care taken to procure and preſerve <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> which muſt ſupport it and make it uſeful, we may ſoon experience a great want of valuable Riches, and have only in its room what is imaginary.</p>
                  <p>A Law for aſſigning or transferring of Bonds or Bills of Debt, of all ſorts of Paper Credit, may be leaſt lyable to Objections, and in ſome meaſure at all times ſupply the want of <hi>Coyn;</hi> for the carrying on of <hi>Trade</hi> and Dealings, ſuch Bonds or Bills being made for Goods received, or ſome Valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, will have a good foundation; and though transferred from one to another, as perſons occaſions may require, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation will not thereby be weakened; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probable that <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Tradeſmens</hi> Bonds or Notes, may, amongſt themſelves, have as good Credit as <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Notes had formerly, and paſs to one from another in Payment, upon ſuch Terms as they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as freely as the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Notes did; and ſuch Credit not likely to be extended beyond what particular perſons Occaſions may require, to carry on their <hi>Trade,</hi> nor paſs without examination of the perſons. Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Circumſtances; whereas the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths</hi> Notes were taken upon an Implicit Faith; or elſe not probable that one <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:34988:38"/>would have been indebted to the People, when the Fire of <hi>London</hi> happened, above 1200000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the aſſigning of Bonds and Bills may in a great meaſure ſupply the want of <hi>Coyn</hi> for the carrying on of Commerce, ſo the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Bills with running Intereſt when paſt on good Funds, ſettled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, may in time be brought to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as to ſupply the Publick with much leſs Charge of Intereſt than formerly. What other Paper Credit may be found neceſſary, ſhould be carefully ſettled by Authority, on good Funds, with Reſtrictions to prevent the extending of ſuch Credits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Funds: For as it is impoſſible for particular perſons to run in Debt beyond their Eſtates, but will run the hazard of loſing their Credit, and conſequently bring their Creditors demands upon them, ſo with Nations or Banks. If Paper Credit do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Funds, and the proſpect of having <hi>Coyn</hi> upon occaſion to anſwer ſuch Credit, may be found a looſe way of Dealing, and ſubject to great dangers and inconveniencies, for moſt likely ſuch Credit may fail when there may be moſt occaſion for the uſe of it, and if once loſt not eaſily recovered, no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be too cautious, with whom they truſt their Riches, nor what they make or allow to paſs for Treaſure, though but arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. Thoſe that are intruſted with the real Treaſure, may probably meet with great Temptations to miſapply it, and the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34988:39"/>or adulterating of the <hi>Coyn,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing of <hi>Trade,</hi> much in their power, and thoſe more that are intruſted with the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Treaſure, or paſſing of Notes or Bills of Credit, if care be not taken to keep them under Reſtrictions and Limitations, may not only become Debtors to the People, for what they pleaſe, but imploy the Money, when got into their hands, as they pleaſe: Which makes ſuch Truſts worthy the Care of the Government; that they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Conſtitution as may not be lyable to the dangers here mentioned.</p>
                  <p>When any Tax or Impoſition is granted by <hi>Parliament,</hi> Tallies, <hi>Exchequer</hi> Notes or Bills, iſſued out upon the ſame, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Government with Ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till the Duties be paid, may have as good Credit as the <hi>Bank</hi> Bills at <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> becauſe grounded on the greateſt Authority, and Publick Faith; but no other Paper Credit, for the Supply of the <hi>Crown,</hi> can be preſumed will be long approved, if our Conſtitution be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The paſſing of <hi>Paper</hi> in Payments was not much practiſed till after <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, had its Original from the Profuſeneſs of the <hi>Court,</hi> taking up great Sums of Money at any rate from the <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> and they from the People, and ſerved inſtead of <hi>Coyn</hi> for the ſupplying the wants of thoſe that, for Goods or otherwayes, had taken Tallies from the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> which at extraordinary
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34988:39"/>Rates were often ſold to the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> for their Notes, which when given out for that, or for other occaſions, did circulate for ſome time, and excuſed the uſe of ſo much <hi>Coyn,</hi> which happily did increaſe <hi>Trade,</hi> but it ended in ſhutting up the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be decided whether the great Debt yet owing to the <hi>Bankers,</hi> ſhall be paid by the Government, or loſt by the People that truſted them, no Judgment can be made who had the Profits gotten by that Paper Credit; and other Loſſes that have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Bankers</hi> ſhould not be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>But though it may be a queſtion whether the Nation, particular perſons, or who, hath got by the Paper Credit as it hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto carried on, yet no doubt but if ſome ſuch Credit could be ſo ſettled, as to avoid the dangers before-mentioned, would be of great uſe: For if a <hi>Banker</hi> upon receipt of a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> give his Note, and that Note circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as Money, and he imploy the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> received, which it is probable he will, tho' the <hi>Banker</hi> have only the particular Gains that may be made by imploying the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, yet the Nation may reap ſome Advantage by having the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> thus dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as to Uſe: The Note may paſs and do ſervice as 1000 <hi>l.,</hi> and the Money as another. And thus the <hi>Coyn</hi> of the Nation may (as to Uſe) be increaſed Two Millions. <hi>Banks</hi> may be neceſſary alſo for the diſcounting of Bills or Tallies, if can be Limited to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Rates, that ſuch Money may circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34988:40"/>in <hi>Trade,</hi> and of great eaſe to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> and others, for the lodging, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or paying of Money.</p>
                  <p>But it is good in the day of proſperity to think of adverſity, and to conſider the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as Conveniencies. Though Notes to a greater Value than Two Millions may circulate, yet if it be found impoſſible to prevent the Cauſes and Accidents, that may occaſion a ſtop to the circulation of ſuch Notes, by a general demand for Money, then Care ſhould be taken to avoid the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; for in ſuch a Caſe, Two Millions in Notes (over and above what Notes or Tallies may be iſſued out, on Taxes or Impoſitions granted by Act of <hi>Parliament</hi>) may be ſufficient to run down the Credit of the greateſt <hi>Bank</hi> or <hi>Bankers.</hi> And being <hi>Paper</hi> hath not uſually paſt in Payment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where but in <hi>London,</hi> and only for ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uſes, and that alwayes a great ſtock of <hi>Coyn</hi> did lye dead to anſwer ſuch Bills for fear of a general run, the number of <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths</hi> conſidered that uſed to paſs ſuch Notes, and to what Value each might iſſue out, it may Reaſonably be concluded, that our <hi>Bankers</hi> Notes did never, ſince the ſhutting up of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> ſerve to multiply the <hi>Coyn</hi> much above Two Millions: But if Notes have circulated for more, and from thence it ſhould be argued, that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity to have the Trade of <hi>Paper</hi> Credit incouraged, good Reſolutions ſhould be taken how ſuch Credit ſhall be ſupported,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34988:40"/>in caſe of a general run; when nothing may ſatisfie, but every Man getting his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It cannot be pretended that any Fund or Security can be more infallible than <hi>Land;</hi> but <hi>Paper</hi> Credit, though <hi>Land</hi> be its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, if intended as running Caſh, will never paſs as Money, longer than Money may be had for ſuch Bills, aſſoon as demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when that fails, ſuch Bills will fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Diſrepute, occaſion Clamours, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a ſtop to <hi>Trade,</hi> and Payments, though the Security be unqueſtionable.</p>
                  <p>A Law to make Bills or Tallies to be a good tender in payment, or to paſs as Money, would have little better ſucceſs than the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of <hi>Coyn</hi> of different Values; the Force will rather be a Diſrepute, and make them ineffectual (as to a general uſe) then be a Credit; and create Oppoſition, rather than facilitate the taking of them. Bills of Exchange from Foreign parts, and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts made afterwards, would be with a proviſo how they ſhall be paid, in what <hi>Coyn.</hi> Whoever may take ſuch Notes or Tallies, and at the ſame time indebted to another, may compel ſuch Debtor to take them: But <hi>Coyn</hi> is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for ſome uſes, and ſo deſirable and eſteem'd, that unleſs Ready Money can be had for ſuch Bills, on Demand, not likely ſhould paſs as Money, further than as the Law may be compulſary, which may be impoſſible to reach future Contracts, and therefore will be of ſo little uſe in Dealings, as may not probably make
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34988:41"/>amends for the hardſhips they will put upon ſuch perſons as may be Creditors at the time of paſſing ſuch an Act. Money may raiſe Credit, or Credit may raiſe Money, and our putting our ſelves in a thriving condition may raiſe both; but of ſuch wayes no proof can be expected, but as in all caſes where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is forced too much. Nothing more likely to occaſion the hoarding up of Money than the Peoples being poſſeſt with a fear, that if they part with it they ſhall have ſuch Notes or Tallies forced upon them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of it; for being they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Money till they become payable on the Funds on which they are iſſued, which (though never ſo good) may not ſuit all Mens occaſions, it cannot be expected they ſhould be willingly taken. A Currency to all the <hi>Coyn</hi> we have, and the Coyning of more, if the Temptations for bringing in of <hi>Plate</hi> take effect, and our putting our ſelves in a poſture of good Husbandry, may recover our Credit; without which, ſuch dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on <hi>Paper</hi> Credit is not likely to ſettle <hi>Trade</hi> on a good foundation.</p>
                  <p>All Men that have Eſtates in Money do conſider how they had beſt diſtribute the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of it to their moſt advantage and conveniency. What they lend out on Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, is uſually ſuch part as they intend for ſome Purchaſe, or for Childrens Portions, which they are moſt willing ſhould continue till ſuch Occaſions call for it. What they lend on Tallies or Loans to the Government,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34988:41"/>they foreſee they ſhall not want till the time alotted for payment expire. What they do not ſo diſpoſe of, they keep for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, or ſuch Occaſions as require Money. Though they ſhould for it take Notes iſſued out upon <hi>Land</hi> Security, payable on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet any jealouſie or ſuſpicion that they ſhall not have Money for ſuch Bills on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, will occaſion a general run, becauſe ſuch Bills or Notes will not ſerve them, for ſuch Occaſions as they have alotted it, longer than Money may be had for them on Demand. The Peoples Occaſions will alwayes make a great difference between what they have lent out on Mortgages, and what they laid out on ſuch Notes, being what they deſigned for their running Caſh. <hi>Paper</hi> Credit was at its heigth before the Fire of <hi>London.</hi> The Fire and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Exploit at <hi>Chatham,</hi> which happened the Year after, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſioned a ſtop to the payment of the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Notes for any long time, and they did then pay Intereſt for much of the Money they had in their hands, yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perceiving by thoſe ſhort interruptions, that ſuch Notes and Bonds could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, to afford them Ready Money at all times, great Sums were drawn out of the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> hands upon it; which diſabling them from ſerving the <hi>Court</hi> as before, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a ſtop to the payment of what was owing them, amounting to 1280754 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d;</hi> it being well known that what they took of the People was moſt Lent to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34988:42"/>
                     <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and being no more, is a further proof that ſuch <hi>Paper</hi> Credit, at that time, did not add to the <hi>Coyn</hi> of the Nation Two Millions, as hath been aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid upon this Subject it may be preſumed, that if there be a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Families in this Nation, that Three or Four Millions of our <hi>Coyn</hi> will lye dead, or circulate amongſt the People for Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or petty Expences, never to be drawn from them in exchange of any <hi>Bank</hi> Notes or Bills whatſoever, becauſe ſuch Notes or Bills cannot ſerve for thoſe purpoſes; each Family, reckoning Rich and Poor alike, may need 3 to 4 <hi>l.</hi> a Family for ſuch uſes. What other <hi>Coyn</hi> the People may have over and above what is neceſſary for ſuch Expences (excepting what may be in the hands of ſome few that may delight in hoarding it) unleſs there be a general diſconfidence as to Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one with another, will not lye dead. What one may receive by giving a Mortgage or Bond, or upon any account, will ſoon be paid to another, as the publick, or Mens particular Occaſions for the carrying on of Commerce, or other Dealings, may require, there being no other way to make Profit by it. If it be found that ſuch part of our <hi>Coyn</hi> is not ſufficient to ſupply our preſent Occaſions, Bills or Notes iſſued out upon Funds, or <hi>Land</hi> Security of a ſufficient Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, payable at certain times, with a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Intereſt, may ſupply the defect thereof, it not appearing impoſſible to make ſuch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34988:42"/>Bills or Notes as ſecure, and ſo conſequently as Valuable as any Mortgage of Lands, Bonds or Specialties whatſoever, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable as Money, and to continue in that eſteem till there be a failure of Payment at the time mentioned, and agreed: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but having a proſpect that <hi>Coyn</hi> will be ready to pay ſuch Bills at their reſpective times, can make them be preferred to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nor preſerve the Reputation of ſuch Bills, or of any Bills, Notes or <hi>Paper</hi> Credit whatſoever, but the having Money ready to make a punctual payment at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt and agreed. No ſuch Bills can ever be brought into practice for Marketing and petty Expences. None paſt for Money lodged, as a running Caſh, will hold their Repute longer than paid when demanded. None tho' iſſued out on <hi>Land</hi> Security payable at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, not longer than while ſuch Bills or Notes are punctually paid at the time agreed. When any failure happens, a ſtop will inevitably be put to the Currency of ſuch Notes, or Bills, and give a preference to <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe People will imagine that <hi>Coyn</hi> cannot be ſubject to ſuch diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore it is thought convenient to ſumme up what hath been ſaid upon this Subject with this Concluſion,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> hath alwayes been eſteemed the Sinews of War. <hi>Paper</hi> Credit may come in, as an aid, in caſe of want, but not to be depended on, either for that or carrying on of Commerce, as principal;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34988:43"/>its original and exiſtence being from Credit, and Opinion, that muſt be obtained, with a proſpect that it will continue, before any uſe can be made of it, but impoſſible to prevent its being ſubject to Chance. Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt be our <hi>Coyn</hi> that in all caſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity muſt be our refuge, it ought to be preferred, that care may be taken how it may be increaſed and preſerved.</p>
                  <p>As many Families have been ruined for want of keeping Accompts, and obſerving how their Incomes have anſwered to their Expences, ſo many Nations for want of the like Eſtimates, and Calculations, and a true Judgment how far their <hi>Coyn</hi> as well as their Credit may be depended on to ſerve their Occaſions. If it appear hazardous to confide too much in <hi>Paper</hi> Credit, or that it may be difficult to be made uſeful (when our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may moſt need it) by any laſting unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Currency, unleſs by Mortgaging Lands or ſome good Funds, and there be a proſpect how <hi>Coyn</hi> will come in for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it at the time agreed, though Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the Exportation of <hi>Coyn</hi> for the carrying on a War in Foreign parts, for the Honour of a Nation, Safety of <hi>Trade,</hi> or the Security of ſuch of our Neighbouring Countries as may be abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve our ſelves, may be allowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe may only be for a time, yet no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be admitted for the carrying on of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſo as to occaſion a conſtant Exportation of our <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34988:43"/>will certainly terminate in a want of thoſe Species, and Credit alſo, and bring Poverty and Deſtruction upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> afford but inconſiderable parcels of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> moſt comes from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and Coaſt of <hi>Afriea,</hi> of which all Nations endeavour to get ſhares: If upon an inquiry it ſhould appear that all the <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> that hath come into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> for theſe Forty Years laſt paſt, never amounted to the value of Two Millions and half <hi>per Annum</hi> of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> and that there is no proſpect any greater quantity will be brought in hereafter, and that the moſt we have had hitherto, or can well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for our ſhare, hath not, or may not hereafter, exceed 600000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> brought here in Specie, over and above what is brought in by Strangers, and carried out again, and that a laviſh Expence at Home of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver Lace, Wire, Fringe,</hi> or for <hi>Gilding,</hi> and ſuch like uſes, hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med 200000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and that the <hi>Northern Trades</hi> have ever ſince the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> carried from us above 200000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> the <hi>India Trade,</hi> ſince the Year 1670, 600000 <hi>l.,</hi> the <hi>French Trade</hi> (till in ſome meaſure ſtopt by the War) 700000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> beſides what is conſtantly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out by ſome other <hi>Trades,</hi> and out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we ſhall find reaſon to conclude that the Stock we had of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> hath of late Years decreaſed, and that we are in as much danger to have what now remains di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34988:44"/>as a Gentleman that hath but 750 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> and yet ſpends 1000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> is of conſuming his Eſtate; and that unleſs we can by altering our courſe of Living put a ſtop to ſuch Conſumptions, and take effectual Methods, to prevent the cauſes that occaſion the Exportation of it, we ſhall in a few Years want Money to carry on our <hi>Trade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Bank</hi> Notes paſt on a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, may paſs from hand to hand as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and may ſo be very uſeful, as a means to carry on Commerce, ſo long as there is a good proſpect and aſſurance, that ſuch Notes will be diſcharged by Money at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt for the payment of them, yet will never deſerve the Name of a New Specie, nor to be eſteemed as <hi>Coyn,</hi> becauſe it will thus only ſerve as a Pledge to gain Time for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Money, but not anſwer the Ends deſigned by Money, which is finally to pay and diſcharge Debts; which can no more be done by ſuch <hi>Bank</hi> Notes, than a Mortgage that is transferred from one to another can be ſaid to be diſcharged, till the Money be paid off by the Owner of the Eſtate Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and Deed cancelled, or Eſtate aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back.</p>
                  <p>The great Advantages which the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> hath reapt by giving the priviledge of a Free Port to the City of <hi>Leghorn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Free Ports.</note> hath made many Advocates for having Free Ports, not well conſidering that this Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with both Natural and Artificial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34988:44"/>People addicted to <hi>Trade,</hi> Ships, and Seamen, to Tranſport them to Foreign Markets, and the ſaid Duke very few, nor any good Foundation for <hi>Trade,</hi> but the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and Convenience of that Port, which without the help of Foreigners could not have been Advantageous to him, becauſe was under theſe Circumſtances; therefore thought good to give incouragement, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Foreign Ships freely to come and go, load or unload any Commodities, paying ſmall Duties, but alſo to all Nations to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, with all the Freedom and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that could be thought neceſſary, to tempt and invite them; which as it was a great piece of Policy, ſo had a very good effect; for thereby, he made that Port a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazeen for the greateſt <hi>Trades</hi> in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and all Ships and Goods leaving ſomething of clear Gains behind them, and the <hi>Trade</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſing to a great degree, as many littles make a mickle, ſo it hath, in a courſe of Years, not only inriched that Port, but the adjacent Country, and filled the Great Dukes Coffers with abundance of Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>However Free Ports may have a quite contrary effect here; for as we do not want Goods to Export, ſo not Ships nor Seamen to carry them abroad, and bring back what we want. If we ſhould make a Free Port, or Ports, though ſuch Ships as come in, and ſuch Goods as they may bring, and load off, may leave ſomething behind them of Profit, yet it would probably prove ſuch a hinderance
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34988:45"/>to our Seamen and Navigation, to our own Merchants and Factors, and to the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own Manufactures, by ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations as may be made, unleſs ſettled with ſuch Reſtrictions and Limitations, as may make a Free Port only in Name but not in Subſtance, that it might prove as diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to us, as it hath proved advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to that Duke; and the Repayment we now make by Debenters on ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of what paid for Cuſtom Imported, when the ſame Goods are Exported, may be ſo ſettled as to give us all the Advantage we can expect by Free Ports.</p>
                  <p>After a full examination of theſe,<note place="margin">Libour and good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry moſt likely to increaſe Riches.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like Propoſals for promoting of <hi>Trade,</hi> and for the preſerving and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Coyn,</hi> though ſome may be found uſeful, yet none will probably conduce ſo much, or ſo certain, to it as the having of many People Laboriouſly imployed, and the preventing of Luxurious, Prodigal Expences and Conſumptions at Home, and coſtly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements Abroad.</p>
                  <p>It is with Nations as with Families: Thoſe Maſters that are careful and good Husbands themſelves, and keep their Servants to their Labour, and frugal in their Expences, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thrive moſt; ſo with Nations, thoſe that have the moſt Induſtrious People, and are moſt Parſimonious, will be the Richeſt: And this is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that all other ways, without it, may prove inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34988:45"/>
                  <p>A Gentleman that hath but 500 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> that is Induſtrious with his Servants in Husbandry, and content with his own, for his Food and Apparel, and careful to avoid unneceſſary Outgoings and Expences, may bring Money into his Houſe and keep it too; but a Gentleman that hath 1000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> that keeps Idle Servants, deſpiſes his own Food and Cloathing, and inſtead thereof takes in <hi>Silks, Wines,</hi> and dear bought Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from Abroad in the room of them, at the end of the Year either cannot bring Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into his Houſe, or not keep it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Debts: The ſame with Nations that neglect the keeping of their People to Profitable Imployments, deſpiſe their own Commodities, and are fond of thoſe that are far fetcht, and dear bought. That undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Maxim, <hi>That the way to be Rich is to be careful in Saving, as well as induſtrious in Getting,</hi> hath the ſame reference to Nations as to particular Perſons, or Families. And although as with perſons that have great Eſtates, the effect of ſuch a kind of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be ſo ſoon perceived as with thoſe that have leſs, yet in a courſe of time, if no remedy be applyed, the ballance of their Accompts will ſtand on the wrong ſide: So with Nations, eſpecially ſuch as have a great <hi>Trade,</hi> may not preſently perceive it; but now that we feel the Effects of it, high time to apply proper Remedies. Thinking and Talking are uſually the firſt ſteps to Reformation; but it is good Reſolutions,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34988:46"/>and a due execution of them, that muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and make it effectual.</p>
                  <p>It is true, nothing of this kind can be done but may prove a hinderance to, or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome <hi>Trades;</hi> but that may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of increaſing others in their room, more Advantageous. <hi>Trades</hi> that are pernicious ought to be deſtroyed, where it appears plain they are ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Sumptuary Laws have ſeldom had any good effect.<note place="margin">Swnp'u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Laws</note> If general, then the Offenders may be too many to admit of ſtrict execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are alwayes looked upon as vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious by the Tradeſmen and Conſumers both. If relate to Foreign Commodities, then the Nations concerned in thoſe Commodities may take offence at them. A good Example in great Perſons, may in many Caſes have as good an effect, if not then no remedy but Lawes, to prevent the Importation of ſuch Goods as may be found prejudicial; it being ſater to keep Thieves out of an Houſe than to depend upon maſtering of them when in. No doubt the People of this Nation are of late Years much changed for the worſe, in courſe of Living: What Tradeſmen and Artificers ſpend extravagantly upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or Families, muſt be advanced in the Price of their Commodities they make or ſell, which is a great means to hinder the expence of ſome of our own Make: For if any other Nation can afford them cheaper, either Abroad or at Home, thoſe that work cheapeſt, moſt likely to have the greateſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34988:46"/>Trades; and the having Workmen cheap moſt likely to occaſion the doing of much, both in Husbandry and Trade. Exceſſive Wages is a load upon a Nation, and exceſs in Apparel or other Expences much the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, or of its continuance; but no way better to prevent it than by Example, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and gaining more People for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Imployments.</p>

Upon an Examination ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the <hi>Custom-Houſe</hi> Books in the Year 1669, it did appear that we ſtood Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to <hi>France,</hi> upon the Ballance of <hi>Trade,</hi> about One Million: And it is concluded, that for Thirty Years ſucceſſively they had a very great advantage upon us. The <hi>Wines, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Silks, Linnens,</hi> and other Goods Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, uſually amounted to One Million and half, and the little they took from us not half a Million, having either prohibited or laid ſuch Duties on many of our Goods, as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Expence: Therefore not ſtrange the inequality ſhould be ſo great, or that vaſt quantities of our <hi>Bullion, Coyn,</hi> or Treaſure, was carried from us to adjuſt thoſe Accompts.</p>
                  <p>The immente Quantities of <hi>Deales</hi> and <hi>Timber</hi> which have been Imported into this Kingdom,<note place="margin">Northern.</note> for the building Thirty or Forty Thouſand Houſes in and about <hi>London,</hi> and many in other places, ſince the great Fire, added to the Coſt of our Naval Stores from <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swedeland,</hi> have for Thirty Years brought us Annually much in Debt to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34988:47"/>thoſe Nations; for thoſe Countries take few of our Goods from us, therefore moſt of what we take from them is paid in Money.</p>
                  <p>In One Year there hath been Exported for carrying on the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>India</hi> Trades.</note> about One Million in <hi>Bullion,</hi> and every Year great Sums. Whether the Goods they bring, and Export to Foreign parts bring back the like Sums in <hi>Bullion,</hi> may be worth an inquiry.</p>
                  <p>There may be other <hi>Trades</hi> that may have ſometimes carried out our <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion;</hi> but if no great Sums, and by the alterations which often happen in <hi>Trade</hi> do at other times bring back the like Species, cannot be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious as theſe mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Trades</hi> we drive to <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34988:48"/>to purchaſe <hi>Raw Silk,</hi> or other Goods, is too much increaſed, may deſerve an inquiry to be prevented, if poſſible; if not, being moſt is for purchaſing <hi>Raw Silk</hi> to be further Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured here, or Exported, if we cannot have it from any other places on better terms, may be found adviſable to permit it. This <hi>Trade</hi> is carried on under a Regulated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whether in all Points convenient, or their Charter needs additional Powers or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, or the Power lodged in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by their Charter, be duely executed, without oppreſſion or hinderance of <hi>Trade,</hi> may be worth an inquiry.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trade</hi> to our Plantations or <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Collonies takes off great quantities of our Products and Manufactures,<note place="margin">Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Handicraft Wares, and furniſhes us with ſome Goods for a further Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctury, and others in great abundance to be Exported to Foreign Nations, eſpecially of <hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Tobacco.</hi> And although ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections may be made againſt the uſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of thoſe Commodities, yet being ſo introduced amongſt us as it may be impoſſible to prevent our having them from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and being a <hi>Trade</hi> which imployes vaſt numbers of Ships and Seamen, ought to be incouraged; for having loſt ſo great a part of our <hi>Fiſhing Trades,</hi> theſe <hi>Trades,</hi> and that to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> are now become the chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Navigation, and Nurſery for Seamen. And if all back doors could be ſhut, that all the Products Exported from

                  <p>
                     <hi>Holland</hi> being ſo near us,<note place="margin">Holland.</note> the <hi>Trade</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is like our Home <hi>Trade</hi> from one Town to another. When they have any Commodity they can afford cheaper than we, a ſmall Conſideration brings it here; the like from us to them; which amounts to a great quantity in a Year: Becauſe being a Trading People they furniſh a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and many of their Neighbouring Countries, being as a Magazine for a General <hi>Trade,</hi> ſupply what they want of their own, by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34988:49"/>fetching Goods from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; by which, and by being Frugal and Laborious, and having great convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in their Navigation by Building and Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheap, they have advanced themſelves by <hi>Trade,</hi> more than other Nations that have plenty of their own. To adjuſt how the Ballance of this <hi>Trade</hi> ſtands will be more difficult than any other, becauſe it varies very much every Year, and at this time moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, becauſe of our Expences with our Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but they do take from us great quantities of our Products, and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and of Plantation Goods.

                     <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Fertile Country,<note place="margin">Ireland.</note> and well Seated for <hi>Trade;</hi> but the People being about Four Fifths bigotred to the Roman Catholick Religion, and impatient to be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England,</hi> have often occaſioned great effuſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood by the many Rebellions, which hath made that Kingdom chargable to us.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34988:49"/>and the averſeneſs the Natural <hi>Iriſh</hi> have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to Induſtry, hath been a hinderance to the improvement of that Country, and to the making it more advantageous to it ſelf, and <hi>England.</hi> And unleſs ſome way can be found out to ſecure their intire dependance upon <hi>England,</hi> grounded as well on Religion as Laws, that <hi>England</hi> may be ſure to reap a laſting advantage by the Labours of the People there, and they can be brought to be more Induſtrious, perpetual Obſtructions will from ſuch Objections ariſe againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to increaſe Riches in that Kingdom, by improving it to the uttermoſt, which will be a continual prejudice to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt there. The increaſe of the <hi>Woolllen</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury in that Kingdom may prove fatal to thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> if ſpeedy care be not taken. The Manufacturing of <hi>Linnen</hi> and the increaſe of <hi>Fiſhing Trades</hi> on the Coaſts that are there convenient for it, may happily, upon an inquiry, be found leſs dangerous.</p>

By the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Fiſhing,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> have made their greateſt numbers of Seamen, and by the <hi>Banks</hi> of <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and thereby make thoſe <hi>Trades</hi> difficult to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved; for as long as we have not a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Seamen over and above what may be imployed in our other <hi>Trades,</hi> difficult to be found that they will go to the <hi>Fiſhing Trades,</hi> in any great abundance, becauſe are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great labour and hardſhip. As to

                        <hi>French</hi> Trade.</note> becauſe hath been for many Years carried on to our Loſs and their great Advantage. Though they were alwayes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at Land, yet could never make any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure at Sea, till ſince the Year 1657, that their greateſt Councils, and Miniſters of State, begun to apply their Thoughts how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Navigation.</hi> Then by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws, or Edicts, to incourage all <hi>Trades,</hi> they thought would prove advantageous, eſpecially ſuch as might incourage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Seamen; which they alſo multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by obliging the Commanders of all Ships to carry, and breed up, a proportion of Young Men every Voyage, for which the Government make an allowance; as alſo by making good Docks, Arſnals, conveniencies for all ſorts of Stores; by incouraging good Artiſts for the Building of Ships; and by Prohibitions, or otherwayes diſcouraging all <hi>Trades</hi> they thought pernicious. By ſuch Methods as theſe in about Ten Years it was obſerved, that their Ships, Seamen and <hi>Trade,</hi> was increaſed from One to Ten; and from having their Power confined to Land, are now become alſo ſo Formidable at Sea, as in ſome meaſure to conteſt with both <hi>Englands</hi> and <hi>Hollands</hi> United Strength. In Times of Peace we did Import from that Country An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vaſt Quantities of <hi>Silks, Linnens,</hi> and other Goods, perfectly Manufactured, 30 or 40000 Tuns of <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Brandies,</hi> great Quantities of <hi>Paper, Prunes, Salt, Rozin,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34988:51"/>Glaſs, Cork, Oakum, Soap, &amp;c.</hi> beſides <hi>Points, Laces, Gloves, Imbroidered Veſtments, Beds,</hi> Toyes and Nicknacks, to a very great Value. Though it be hard to define what Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we ever had from that Nation that were Profitable for us, or abſolutely Neceſſary, (unleſs the <hi>Salt</hi>) fit for any Improvement or further Manufactury, yet we permitted that <hi>Trade</hi> to go on, though at the ſame time that we took ſuch vaſt Quantities of Unprofitable Commodities from them, they totally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the expence of all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods from us, and laid ſuch Impoſitions on our <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods as was <hi>tant amont</hi> to a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; thereby bringing us indebted to them for great Sums every Year, which they took from us in <hi>Coyn, Bullion,</hi> or Treaſure, as before-mentioned. They alſo had another great Advantage at that time by our Nobility and Gentry being ſo ſond of Travelling or Living in <hi>France.</hi> It hath been computed that by this Article only they might get near 200000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year from us in Money.</p>
                  <p>The Ambition, Conduct, Strength, and Riches, of that Nation having lately appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo terrible to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly to this Kingdom, by their endeavours to get the poſſeſſion of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Newport,</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and thereby to have had the <hi>

Nothing can be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as matters now ſtand between us and the <hi>French,</hi> than to permit any thing we can prevent that may tend to the increaſe of their Naval Strength, or the diminiſhing of ours; what they have already being ſuch an impending Evil, and a Rod over us, by the Advantage they have by their Ports in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Ocean and our Channel, as may require ever hereafter what may be called a ſtanding Army of Seamen, as well as many Men of War, in a conſtant readineſs to protect our <hi>Trade,</hi> in which there will be great difficulties, as well as to prevent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, which will be a great addition to the Charge of the Government, even in times
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34988:52"/>of Peace. The Law already made for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>French</hi> Goods lyable to pay ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Duties as amounts to a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will put a neceſſity upon them to come to a Treaty of Commerce; in which care may be taken that they have not any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon us, by any <hi>Trade</hi> in Groſs Goods, but it may be difficult to find out any way to prevent their pilfering upon us by ſmuggling <hi>Trades,</hi> by which, carried on in Goods of no great Bulk, in time of Peace, they drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us of more Money than by their Groſs Goods; and ſince this War have conſtantly drawn from us great Sums. Nothing more like to prevent it, and the like from other Countries, than a Law, that all <hi>Wrought Silks, Linnens, Ribbons, Points, Laces,</hi> and ſuch like Commodities, ſhall be forfeited in all hands or places where they are found, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſealed with Seals, that may be put on by Officers of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> or others, which may poſſibly be ſo contrived, as to put it beyond the Art of Man to counterfeit, and not be found out. Without ſome ſuch Law, and Certificates from Abroad, by which it may be known from what Countries ſuch Goods do come, not likely to prevent Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations from putting upon us, on any terms, what Goods they pleaſe of great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, though of ſmall Bulk; by which as the King hath alwayes been defrauded of great Sums in his Cuſtoms, ſo will ever, and the Nation of more, by ſuch loſing <hi>Trades,</hi> not to be prevented but by a ſtrict Law for ſiezing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34988:53"/>of ſuch Goods. Alſo the incouragement of our <hi>Silk, Linnen,</hi> and <hi>Paper</hi> Manufacturies, which are the great Staple Commodities of <hi>France,</hi> may conduce very much to the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ballance of that <hi>Trade,</hi> or to bring them upon an equal foot with us. If we ſhould hereafter take from them as many <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Braendies</hi> as formerly, they may ſerve to intoxicate, but never to inrich us. And though it may be argued that the firſt Coſt and Charges in <hi>France</hi> of 40000 Tons Shipt Aboard is not above 200000 <hi>l.</hi> yet it would be a great Mortification to the <hi>French</hi> if that were with-held, hard to be born by their Landed Men, whoſe Incomes ariſe from thoſe Commodities, and be a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other <hi>Trades,</hi> from whence we can have <hi>Wines</hi> in return of our Products; but moſt for our Intereſt, to ſpend no more <hi>Wine</hi> than our Forefathers did.</p>

                  <p>Being the giving a full Account of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, Progreſs, Management, Cauſes of the Increaſe of this Trade, and Complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, may conduce to the making a good and ſpeedy Settlement of it, the following particulars, though may appear tedious, will not be unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Several Charters have been formerly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Management of this Trade by a Corporation, and Joint-Stock, which upon an examination will be found were alwayes attended with great Complaints, and no good ſucceſs. The laſt Stock was underwrit by Vertue of a Charter granted <hi>Anno</hi> 1657, ſince often confirmed, and augmented, with extraordinary Powers, the Stock then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writ about 744000 <hi>l.</hi> of which only 372000 <hi>l.</hi> was taken in. The Trade carried on for ſome Years by the Exportation of Goods and about 40000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Bullion,</hi> Shipt off by a Privy Seal, or Licenſe from the <hi>Court,</hi> for that purpoſe, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1663, when an Act of Parliament came in force for the Free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> then it begun to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out in much greater quantities; but the Importations were chiefly <hi>Druggs, Saltpetre,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34988:54"/>Spices, Courſe Callicoes,</hi> and <hi>Diamonds,</hi> until after <hi>Anno</hi> 1670, then <hi>Throwſters, VVeavers, Dyers,</hi> and ſuch like Tradeſmen, were ſent out by the Company to teach the <hi>Indians</hi> to make all ſorts of Manufactured Goods, in ſuch manner as might beſt pleaſe the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> and be moſt profitable for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Till then the Trade in Manufactured Goods, or <hi>Raw Silk,</hi> was inconſiderable in Value, and not much <hi>Bullion</hi> Exported; thoſe Gentlemen, that had the Management of the Affairs of that Company before, often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, <hi>That they would not adventure on thoſe Commodities, leaſt ſhould indanger the ruin of our own Manufacturies, and of the</hi> Turkey <hi>Trade, and raiſe a ſtorm against the Company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ill Weeds grow apace, ſo theſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured Goods from <hi>India</hi> met with ſuch a kind reception, that from the greateſt Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants to the meaneſt Cook-Maids, nothing was thought ſo fit, to adorn their perſons, as the Fabricks of <hi>India;</hi> nor for the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chambers like <hi>India-Skreens, Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Beds</hi> and <hi>Hangings;</hi> nor for Cloſets, like <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Lacquered VVare;</hi> and the Melting down of our Milled Money, that might by the name of <hi>Bullion</hi> be Exported to purchaſe them, not at all conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The Humours and Fancies of the People thus combining with the deſign of thoſe that had the Management of the Affairs of that Company, to make a beneficial Trade to ſuch as had ingroſt the Stock, no Endeavours
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34988:55"/>were omitted, no Addreſſes to the <hi>Court</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, nor Expences valued, that might tend to improve this good Opportunity; which ſoon occaſioned a very great increaſe for the ſupply of all thoſe that were fond of thoſe Commodities, and large and plentiful Dividends out of the Stock, for thoſe that had ingroſt this Trade.</p>
                  <p>But this great increaſe of Trade in ſuch Goods could not be made without ſome hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the Profit of others, by the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their Trades, which were in a manner ſwallowed up by this from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> that they might help themſelves by proper Methods, <hi>Anno</hi> 1681, preſented a Petition to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, for the inlarging the Stock and Adventurers in this Trade, Signed by the Ableſt Merchants on the <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and great numbers, and the Matter was referred to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſeveral Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council; where it was Argued in the behalf of the Petitioners:</p>
                  <p>That though this Trade be now increaſed to be above one quarter part of the Trade of this Nation, yet it doth not now ſupport or entertain, as Adventurers or Proprietors, more perſons than it did when the Company was firſt Settled, though the Trade was not the One Tenth part ſo much; for the Stock not being increaſed by New Subſcriptions proportionable to the Trade, but continuing the ſame 372000 <hi>l,</hi> as at firſt, upon which all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34988:55"/>Sales and Dividends are made, the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers inſtead of being increaſed from 900 they were at firſt, to 9000, as the increaſe of the Trade required, are reduced to 550 perſons.</p>
                  <p>Such are the corruptions that have grown up with time in the Management of this Trade, that the major part of the Gains therefore is divided amongſt Forty Perſons, and the whole Adminiſtration and Command of it in the hands of Ten or Twelve Men, who under the name of a Publick, carry on a Particular Intereſt by Private Trade, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ships they imploy, and other by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Method which this Company practiced of carrying on the Trade by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up One Million of Money on a Common Seal at Intereſt, is not only indirect and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous (becauſe oftentimes they have not in <hi>England</hi> to pay One Fifth of what they owe, and there is a poſſibility their Ships may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry but alſo very unequal to the Subject, the Members of the Company reaping near 100 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Gains <hi>per Annum</hi> thereby, but the Lenders only 4 or 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the major part of the People of this Nation now living, were either minors or unborn when this Trade was firſt Settled, and many that Traded in <hi>Linnens</hi> from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Flanders, Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Silks</hi> from <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and of our own Manufacturies, have their Trades ſwallowed up by this from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34988:56"/>thereby deprived of their Livelihoods, and can have no reparation but by an Admiſſion into this Trade.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the inlarging of the Stock would occaſion the inlarging of the Trade to <hi>Moca, Arracon, Achein, Sumatra,</hi> St. <hi>Lawrence, Pegu, Mozambig, Sofoia, Melinda, Borneo, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> all places capable of a great Trade, which would be of great Advantage to the Navigation, his Majeſties Cuſtoms, and his Subjects in General.</p>
                  <p>It is agreeable to the order of a General-Court, which this Company made at their firſt Setting up, and the Arguments which they then offered to induce his Majeſty to Grant them their <hi>Charter,</hi> that they would at the end of Seven Years Ballance their Books and open them for New Subſcriptions, that ſo other Perſons might come into the ſaid Trade; which is a more Natural and equal way then Carrying on the Trade by taking Mony at Intereſt on a Common Seal.</p>
                  <p>Though this Company had been the firſt Diſcoverers of this Trade, yet it is not uſual to permit that thoſe who Invent or Diſcover any thing Improveable for common Good, ſhould keep ſuch Diſcoveries to themſelves and Succeſſors to perpetuity; only a certain Term of Years for Incouragement: But this Company being not the Diſcoverers, and having enjoyed the Trade 24 Years, and made Ten for One of their Mony, have been ſufficiently Rewarded; others without Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they Sowed have expired for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:34988:56"/>
                  <p>If this <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade ſhould go on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing as of Late, and come to be Double or Treble what it now is; yet without a new Settlement and larger Stock, the Advantages will be Contracted to as few Perſons as now; it being probable that as it hath been more and more ingroſt ever ſince the Year 1666, when firſt it begun to get Repute, no one Man having then to the Value of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Stock, now ſeveral 50000 <hi>l.</hi> a Peice, and One above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> So the ſame Temptations will occaſion the further Ingroſſiing of it, thereby to keep the Management in their own hands, by which they will continue Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantages of the ſaid Trade, though ſhould grow never ſo great, and have as much Security for their Mony as the Treaſure of the <hi>Nation</hi> taken up on a Common Seal can afford.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe other Trades having for ſeveral Years paſt afforded no Conſiderable Gains, ſeveral Perſons who could not procure Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into this Company, have ingaged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Interloping Trade, which may in time prejudice the Trade it Self, which the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books for new Subſcriptions, and the inlarging of the Stook may probably prevent, becauſe it would draw in moſt of the Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People of the <hi>Nation</hi> to be concerned, and Leave no Temptations for the <hi>Interlopers</hi> to continue Trading Separate.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it is apparent the <hi>Turky</hi> Trade is of great Advantage to this <hi>Nation,</hi> Export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Yearly above 400000 <hi>l.</hi> in our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34988:57"/>and bringing home profitable and neceſſary Goods in return thereof, and in danger to be deſtroyed by this from the <hi>India,</hi> by their Importation of ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wrought and Raw <hi>Silks.</hi> It would be Severe, if they who have deſerved well of the <hi>Nation</hi> by Carrying on that Trade, ſhould have no way to come into this, which is like to deſtroy theirs.</p>
                  <p>Without New Subſcriptions there can be no way of coming into this Trade under this <hi>Charter,</hi> but by Buying Shares in the Stock of the preſent Adventures, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Liberty and Freedom which hath always been approved for Admiſſion into Trade to the ſame difficulty as to attain the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Lands;</hi> for one Man cannot Buy any Stock, unleſs another will Sell, nor unleſs the Buyers will give the Price de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and experience hath diſcovered that it's ſo ſeldom any Stock offers to be Sold, that it can no way Anſwer the Objections made againſt the Preſent Company: For thoſe who have the greateſt Stocks, inſtead of Selling, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate more; and it is only ſome ſmall Sums by chance eſcape their hands; but if there were more to be Sold, it would but exchange the Intereſt of <hi>A. B.</hi> for <hi>C. D.</hi> and no way be Subſervient to the bringing in of more People or Stock into the Trade; and it will be more agreeable to his Majeſties Bounty, and Goodneſs, that his Subjects ſhould enter into this Trade by a Door of his opening, then by the Courteſie of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34988:57"/>Preſent Adventurers, and ſuch a narrow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous way as they allow of, which cannot extend to any Conſiderable number of People, nor to thoſe who moſt want his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties help, [the meaneſt] becauſe they have not Mony to Buy 100 <hi>l.</hi> Stock at the Rate it now goeth of 500 <hi>l.</hi> and leſs Sums are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never Sold; by which means if there were no other, the Major part of the People are prevented from coming into this Trade.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this Company by ſending over to the <hi>Eaſt Indies, Dyers, Throwſters, Weavers,</hi> and Inſtruments for the Setting up of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies there, and by the Contraction which they have made of the Advantages of this Trade to ſo ſew Perſons, and the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and danger which ariſeth by carrying on this Trade by Mony taken up on a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seal at Intereſt, and by the particular Intereſt which they carry on in their Private Trade, owning of Ships they employ, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Siniſter ways, have Degenerated from their Primitive Nature, and directed and managed His Majeſties <hi>Charter</hi> to purpoſes different to His Gracious intendment and Royal Grant, which was the Good of his People in general, by Converting and Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid <hi>Charter</hi> to be only Subſervient to their particular Advantage; and therefore ill deſerve to be continued in the enjoyment of ſuch extraordinary Gains ſo contrary to the Intereſt of the <hi>Nation</hi> in General.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Members of this Company have enjoyed it ſo long, as they have almoſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34988:58"/>forgot the Donors Right, and the Nature of their Tenure, Pleading their <hi>Charter,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and Poſſeſſion (which cannot give them any Right but during His Majeſties pleaſure) in oppoſition to His Majeſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bounty, and Goodneſs, intended to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtributed amongſt all his Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as he is a Common Father to them all.</p>
                  <p>Though His Majeſty, and former Kings his Royal Predeceſſors, have Granted <hi>Charters</hi> for Incorporating of Trades to a ſet number of their Subjects named in them; yet it was never intended to their private Uſe, nor as an Inheritance to them; but ſuch Perſons Names were only uſed as in truſt for the Publick good, that being the Royal end, which His Majeſty, and the Kings Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, always deſigned. And this is manifeſt by the Proviſo His Majeſty was pleaſed to make in this <hi>Charter,</hi> That when this <hi>Charter</hi> either in Whole or in Part was not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Majeſty or his Realm, that then and from thenceforth after Three Years warning it ſhould expire to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>By the Example of former Ages, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that other Companies have had their determination for publick Good, as may be Inſtanced in many Companies that have managed the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Guiney</hi> Trade, and moſt of them after had loſt great Eſtates in the Carrying on of the ſaid Trade; which if particular Intereſt muſt be Conſidered will
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34988:58"/>be found much Severer than to have this <hi>Eaſt-India.</hi> Company expire after 24 Years enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Reaping of ſo great Advantages thereby.</p>
                  <p>Trade is to the Body Politick as Blood to the Body Natural, if have it's Circulation apt to relieve the Wounded, or moſt needy Part, (the meaneſt) but if obſtructed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways diſordered in Motion, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably weaken one part, and over nouriſh others: If all the other Trades of this <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhould be Incorporated, and thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, it is obvious that it would inrich on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 160 Perſons, and not maintain as Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers above 2000 Perſons in all: And if ſuch a Contraction would have a bad effect, if all Trades were ſo managed, ſo it muſt have ſome proportion in the Contraction; which is apparent in this great Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> eſpecially if it be Conſidered what a numberleſs quantity of People there are in this <hi>Nation,</hi> which have their dependance on Trade for their Livelihoods.</p>
                  <p>If this Trade be not intended for an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to theſe few Perſons who are now in the Poſſeſſion of all the Advantages and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it, the preſent Conjunction is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune for the determination of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as well in reference to affairs abroad, as at home: Our Neighbouring <hi>Nations</hi> not being in a Condition to take advantage of the Tranſition, and at home it will anſwer the Complaints which are made of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of other Trades, and want of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34988:59"/>for Ships Stock, and people deſigned for Trade.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe there can be no danger of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the Trade by this inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for if time be given to this Company for the drawing in of their Effects, in that time the Pulſe of the <hi>Nation</hi> will appear by the new Subſcriptions, if Books be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, and if there do not offer ſufficient Subſcribers for ſuch a New Stock, as is propoſed, then this Company may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, notwithſtanding any intimation that may be given for their determination; but if Two Millions, or what elſe may be thought a Convenient Stock ſhould be underwrit, then there will be no difficulty in Carrying on the Trade without any Intermiſſion, with no more danger then the Exchange of Committees now <hi>Annually</hi> made doth occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the increaſe of the Stock, as it will prove ſeveral ways Advantageous to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſatis fie the Complaints that ariſe from the Contraction of the ſaid Trade, and difficulties of Admiſſion into it, ſo it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the Inlarging thereof; and if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Company have time to draw off their Effects, and ſatisfaction for their dead Stock, and leave to underwrite in the New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the 372000 <hi>l.</hi> which they have Original Stock in the Old, there can be no injury done them; they will be only reduced to an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Trade with the reſt of the Trading People; in doing of which there can be no more danger then in Lopping of the exuberant
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34988:59"/>Branches of a Tree, opening the Root and giving it freſh ſupplies of Water.</p>
                  <p>That if it ſhould appear that any Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured Goods were broguht from the <hi>Indies,</hi> that were a detriment to the <hi>Nation</hi> by hindring the Expence of ſuch as were made here, or that Raw <hi>Silk</hi> could not be brought from thence upon as good terms as from <hi>Turky;</hi> that Proviſion might be made in the New <hi>Charter</hi> to prevent all Inconveniencies from ſuch Commodities.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Petition theſe Arguments and others that were offered upon that occaſion, the King was pleaſed to direct that the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhould propoſe ſome Methods how the ſaid Stock and Adventurers ſhould be inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without prejudice to his Cuſtoms, and the Trade, which were accordingly made, but after ſome time all endeavours of that kind were rejected; upon which many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, sand others, having the opinion of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel Learned in the Law, that the Clauſes in the <hi>Charter</hi> impowering the Company to Seize the Ships, or Goods of their fellow Subjects, were Illegal, did equip ſeveral Ships with Rich <hi>Cargoes</hi> to ſend to the <hi>Indies;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, the Ship <hi>Commerce,</hi> Captain <hi>Sands</hi> with 50000 <hi>l. Cargoe,</hi> and although did not enter his Ship or Goods in the Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe for the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet upon a Petition from the Company to the King, Suggeſting they were informed that the ſaid Ship was deſigned for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> after ſeveral ſtops to his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34988:60"/>diſpatch at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> an Order was ſent to the Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> that they ſhould cauſe the ſaid Ship to be Arreſted until ſufficient Security were given that the ſaid Captain ſhould not ſail within the Limits of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies Charter. The ſaid Ship being ſtopt, and Men put aboard to keep poſſeſſion, that ſhe might not ſtir, <hi>Sands</hi> by Writ brought the Caſe to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in order to get a Prohibition, but after much Coſt, Charge and Delays, a Prohibition was denyed him; then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to eaſe themſelves of the Charge of keeping their Men aboard, obtained the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HIS Majeſty having Information that the Court of</hi> Kings Bench <hi>hath this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to grant a Prohibition to</hi> Sands <hi>the Interloper, hath commanded me to ſignifie to you, that it is his deſire and pleaſure, that all care imaginable be uſed to continue the Ship in queſtion under the Arreſt of the Admiralty, as now ſhe is, till it be otherwayes ordered by due courſe of Law: And to the end there may be no poſſibility to break that Arreſt, and to ſail away the Ship, His Majeſty would have all the Sails and the Rudder it ſelf, taken away by the proper Officer, and ſecured, ſo as no uſe may be made of them. His Majeſty is pleaſed to give this Order thus ſoon, becauſe it is told him, That aſſoon as this News reacheth the Interlopers, they may very probably direct and attempt to have the Ship ſail away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34988:60"/>render the Judicial Reſolutions of this day of no effect or avail to His Majeſties Rights, and just Prerogative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>February 10. 1682/3.</p>
                  <p>The Contents of which Letter was exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed by the Admiralty, and the Ship lay under the ſaid Arreſt Twelve Months, notwithſtanding all endeavours in Courts of Juſtice, or elſewhere, then the concerned ſold their Ship and Cargoe with great Loſs, and ſo ended their Voyage.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this diſcouragement, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merchants did equip other Ships, and got them clear out; of which the Company being informed, they obtained an Order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kings Sign Manual, to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Phenix,</hi> a Fourth Rate Frigat, that he ſhould ſail to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Trade granted by Charter to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, againſt Pyrates and Interlopers, as might from time to time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Directions from the General or Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency at <hi>Surrat;</hi> and accordingly the ſaid Ship proceeded for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the ſaid General and Companies Factors at <hi>Surrat</hi> did frequently by Letters adviſe the ſaid Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>where fat Interlopers</hi> (as they call them) <hi>might be met with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the further Security of the ſaid Trade againſt Pyrates and Interlopers, the Company gave Commiſſions to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their own Ships under their Common Seal in theſe words:</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34988:62"/>but about the Year 1686. Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were taken to make ſuch Pyrates alſo.

                  <p>The bloody Tragedy which was acted at the Iſland of <hi>Sancta Helena, Anno</hi> 1685; the Illegal Impriſonments which have been frequently made at Fort St. <hi>George, Bombay,</hi> and other places Abroad; the violent Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that were about that time carried on in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> the vaſt Sums of Money that have appeared, and much greater which have not yet been made publick, that have been expended in Secret Services, to gain the ſteps before-mentioned, to defeat all endeavours to obtain any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the management of the ſaid Trade, and to juſtifie and defend the execution of ſuch Powers; and that thoſe which ſuffered could never obtain any Redreſs or Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as may hereafter be thought a blemiſh on our Government, ſo doth deſerve to be entered as a Caveat againſt the Incorporating of Trades with Joint-Stocks, or at leaſt for the taking of great Care that the like Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Violations may not happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by ſuch Settlements; for there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be a great temptation from particular Intereſt to extend their Powers beyond their due Limits; the perſons that have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement being too apt to conclude there cannot be any great danger of making Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34988:65"/>or being called to an account; for if they have a good Stock, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Trade, will ſuppoſe that in Caſes of difficulty they ſhall alwayes be able to charm the Great, and over-power their Equals; and that the Common Seal only muſt bear the reproach and blame of all. The integrity and ability of the Members concerned in ſuch Stocks having been found by experience to be no ſecurity againſt the Abuſing of Powers granted to Corporations.</p>
                  <p>The Advocates for Settling this Trade in a Joint-Stock uſually alledge, That the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> is remote, and cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be carried on without it: That there are and muſt be ſeveral Forts and Caſtles, and Factories, in ſeveral Princes Countries, with which Princes differences do ariſe, and oftentimes with the <hi>Dutch:</hi> That there is a neceſſity of Souldiers and Garriſons at the Iſle of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> Fort St. <hi>George, Bombay, &amp;c.</hi> none of which can be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great Charge: That there is occaſion to make Treaties and Agreements with the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and other Princes, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be managed by particular perſons: That they imploy great Ships, and breed up a great number of Seamen: That they bring a great deal of Treaſure to the Nation by what Goods they bring and tranſport into Foreign parts; and that others ſpent here at Home are very uſeful, and come cheaper to us than we ſhould otherwayes have them: That they have been long in the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34988:65"/>this Trade, and have a right to their Forts and Caſtles which they bought and paid for: That their Adventurers are numerous, and therefore the Trade as diffuſive under the Company as can be made otherwayes, and that all perſons may come in at any time by buying Stock: And that it being laid open before the Year 1657, when this Charter was firſt obtained, it was reduced to ſuch a languiſhing condition in a few Years, that the Traders that purſued it ſoon loſt much by it, and all joined in an application for getting it ſettled by a Charter in a Joint-Stock; and that the like will happen again if it ſhould be laid open, if not loſt to the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or other Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Oppoſers have offered againſt theſe Arguments, That though the Trade be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, yet that the <hi>Indians</hi> do as kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all perſons that come there to Trade, and with as much Civility and Security, as any people in <hi>Europe;</hi> and that the Company could never get any favour in Trade amongſt the Natives above other people, unleſs by force and indirect means, as the <hi>Interlopers</hi> have experienced: That the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Helena</hi> are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the Juriſdiction of <hi>England,</hi> and without much Charge may be maintained, ſo as to ſerve for a watering place for the Ships as they come home: That the Forts of St. <hi>George, Bencoolon,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> were never of any uſe more than as Warehouſes; and as ſuch Fort St. <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Bombay</hi> not very ſerviceable, becauſe moſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34988:66"/>of the Trade is carried on at a great diſtance, and none of them capable to be defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Indians</hi> by Land, or <hi>Dutch</hi> by Sea, if they ſhould come with any force to attack them: That Treaties and Agreements with Princes in the <hi>Indies,</hi> may be made with their Miniſters, by any ſingle perſon, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and others, being alwayes ready to treat with any Merchants, and that there is no need of going to the Prince himſelf: That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade imploys many Ships, and ſome very good, but that it is rather a Conſumption than Nurſery of Seamen, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away generally only the choiceſt, and ſometimes burying half of them: That the long poſſeſſion this Company have had of this Trade for near Forty Years, makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, it being not reaſonable any ſet of Men ſhould keep ſo great a part of the Trade of the Nation in ſucceſſion to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, excluſive to others, who have as much right to it as they: That the Forts and Caſtles cannot properly be ſaid to belong to them, but only in Truſt for the Government; and the Trade not ſo diffuſive as ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Stock is ingroſt by a few: That the <hi>Dutch</hi> being in poſſeſſion of ſo many Ports and large Territories in the <hi>Indies,</hi> have ſuch ſtrength at Sea, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the caſe now ſtands, to keep them in awe by ſtrength there; and that this Company never could, as appears by their having loſt to them all that they ever thought worth taking, <hi>Amboyna, Polleroone,</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:34988:66"/>and all the <hi>Spice</hi> Iſlands, or Factories which we had in any ſuch Iſlands, and lately <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi> and what we now have, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not be at the Charge of keeping, if they had them.</p>
                  <p>But leaving theſe Old Complaints and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. If Corporations in Trade with Joint-Stocks ſhould appear to be in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all intents and purpoſes Monopolies, miſchievous to Trade, and as much an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe upon ſuch People that buy any Goods Imported by ſuch Companies, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Stock, as if it were ſaid in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect words, that all ſuch perſons ſhould pay in all they buy 20 or 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary towards the inriching the Proprietors of that Stock, added to the inconveniencies before-mentioned that attend the contracting or incorporating of Trades, whether then it be not worth an inquiry if ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for Regulated Companies may not be contrived to anſwer all Arguments offer'd for Joint-Stocks, and prevent the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, where any Trade abſolutely requires Regulations? But all attempts of this kind may meet great oppoſition; it being a fair ſtep to Riches to have a great Trade, and happily the moſt beneficial, ſeparated and confined chiefly for the advantage of thoſe few that can get the management of it; therefore not ſtrange that moſt of our Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and Greateſt Traders ſhould now be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Joint Stocks, and endeavour to ſupport them.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:34988:67"/>
                  <p>If Companies with Joint-Stocks were at firſt intended for the good of Trade, have certainly of late deviated from their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtitutions; for too many have by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding their Stocks amongſt themſelves much prejudiced the Trades they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, ſelling Pretences and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (after the Stock is divided) to ſuch as were excluded, who muſt come into ſuch Trades upon ſuch terms as they pleaſe to impoſe on them, or not at all, made Stock-Jobbing their chief Trade, and ruined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome good deſigns for the promoting of Trade.</p>
                  <p>It is true, when a Trade is firſt Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it is uſually on condition, that all may come in, and ſubſcribe within a time prefixt, that will, and ſuch as do not ſubſcribe within that time, to be excluded.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch Corporations when once ſettled being not eaſily broken, thoſe that get into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion uſually endeavour to keep ſuch Trades, if Profitable, as if were their Inheritance, ſuch Merchants-Traders or others that may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe at the time of the Books being opened were beyond Sea, or under ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Incapacity, as Minors, or otherwayes, not then in a condition to ſubſcribe, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and may probably ever complain, that they are deprived of their Birth-rights, and that it is hard and unequal they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from ſuch Trades when the Members of ſuch Incorporations are not excluded from coming into theirs.</p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34988:67"/>
                  <p>And as the ſettling of Trades in Joint-Stocks makes a great inequality between thoſe that are of the Company and thoſe that are excluded, ſo more amongſt themſelves: For when the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade was in its moſt flouriſhing condition, ten Men owned one quarter part of the ſaid Stock, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Forty the one half, who thereby getting the Management made more Gains in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than any of the reſt of the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, getting the aſcendent and commands by ingroſſing the Stock.</p>
                  <p>As thoſe that live in <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> would probably complain if a priviledge were granted to the County of <hi>Surry</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> to have the ſole ſelling of <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Cattle</hi> to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that ſhould thereby have Proviſions dear; ſo all incorporating of Trades will alwayes be attended with the like Complaints, for they will have in ſome meaſure the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and afford the like grounds.</p>
                  <p>All will agree that Trade ought not to be ſtinted and contracted to the Advantage of ſome few; but diffuſive for the incouragement of Induſtry, and free for all perſons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in. Joint-Stocks may be a good way to advance ſome Trading Men, but whether may probably advance the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or anſwer the chief ends deſigned by Trade ſhould be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The Manufactured Goods from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the Toyes and Nicknacks, before this War, being in great eſteem, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34988:68"/>conſumed, it hath been computed that 400000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> was uſually laid out here at Home, for the purchaſing of them; and if it be conſidered that all perſons of all degrees did wear or ſpend ſome of thoſe Commodities, it may reaſonably be concluded the Coſt of thoſe Goods did rather amount to more than leſs.</p>
                  <p>If upon examination it ſhould appear that the <hi>Perſian Taffaties, Wrought Silks, Painted</hi> and <hi>Dyed Callicoes,</hi> are ſpent here in the room of our Home-made <hi>Silks,</hi> and of ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Stuffs</hi> made at <hi>Norwich, Canterbury, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, Exon,</hi> and other places.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Courſe Callicoes, Muſlins,</hi> and other <hi>Linnens,</hi> are a great obſtacle to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our <hi>Linnen</hi> Manufactures, and are purchaſed with Money; whereas we might have ſuch <hi>Linnens</hi> as we could not make our ſelves in returns of our Products.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Cabinets, China, Lacquered</hi> and <hi>Japan Ware,</hi> and ſeveral other ſorts of Goods that come ready made, are too coſtly to the Nation, a great hinderance to the imploy of our own People, and a prodigal unprofitable Expence.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Goats Hair</hi> hinders the Importation of ſo much from <hi>Turkey</hi> from whence we might have moſt of it in return of our own Manufacturies and Products.</p>

                  <p>Then the only Queſtion will be, whither we had beſt ſend our <hi>Mony</hi> to <hi>India</hi> to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy and inrich the People, and advance <hi>Lands</hi> there by purchaſing their Goods, or keep our <hi>Mony</hi> at home that it may circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late amongſt our Selves, and have the ſame Effect here by uſing our own Goods, or ſuch as can be purchaſed by Exchange of them?</p>
                  <p>It was never affirmed, nor preſumed that Goods brought from <hi>India,</hi> and ſpent here did bring us in any <hi>Bullion</hi> in return of the great quantities carryed out. The <hi>Bullion</hi> that ever was pretended to be brought in by that <hi>Trade,</hi> hath always been ſuppoſed to be by the Goods brought thence, and Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hence to Foreign Markets; which part of that <hi>Trade</hi> may be continued, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the forementioned Goods here ſhould be Prohibited.</p>
                  <p>If it be found that notwithſtanding we have had ſuch ſcarcity of <hi>Bullion</hi> of late, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 400000 <hi>l.</hi> was Shipt off for the Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of this <hi>Trade</hi> by the Company and <hi>Interlopers</hi> between <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> laſt paſt; and that the Five Millions of <hi>Milled Mony</hi> Coyned in the laſt Reigns, much of our <hi>Gold</hi> and of our Broad and Weightieſt <hi>Mony</hi> hath been Exported; and that no Law is like to hinder the Melting down, or Exporting of our New <hi>Mony</hi> without recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Trades.</hi> If we are in good earneſt to endeavour to prevent it, where ſhall the Reformation begin, if nothing muſt be done to this <hi>Trade,</hi> which it is obvious doth Carry

                  <p>If a ſtop be put to the Conſumption here of Goods Manufactured in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> then the <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods that Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are now obliged to ſend out, with a much leſs Sum of <hi>Bullion</hi> then hitherto, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to purchaſe the Goods brought home to be Tranſported, which may prevent the Exportation of much <hi>Bullion Annually;</hi> and it would be our own Faults if we ſhould take either <hi>Silks,</hi> or <hi>Linnens,</hi> or the like ſorts of Goods from our Neighbours for <hi>Mony</hi> in the room of them; for our <hi>Weavers</hi> are come to ſuch perfection in making of <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs,</hi> and ſuch ſorts of good <hi>Linnen</hi> have been, and are now made here, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be improved, as that we may want few from abroad, or none, but what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in return of our Products and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturies.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Trade</hi> hath been alſo managed by a Company in a Joynt-Stock, which was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed about the year 1672. Springing out of the Ruins of a former Company. A <hi>Charter</hi> was then Granted, and the Powers afterwards inlarged and executed after the Pattern of that for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, by which alſo many Suffered to the greateſt extremity, and the Plantations whither becauſe they were not plentifully Served with <hi>Negroes,</hi> or not upon good Terms, or becauſe they were unwilling to have their all (for their being ſupplied with <hi>Negroes</hi> is ſo to them) Subjected to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Corporation, have made frequent Complaints againſt this Company as well as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34988:70"/>thoſe that loſt their Ships, Goods, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, or were deterred from Trading thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This <hi>Trade</hi> was never yet advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any Company. Upon the Settling of this laſt ſome ſcrupulous perſons took the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our ableſt Divines, whether it were Lawful or not to Sell and Buy Mankind, upon which this Trade doth much depend? Moſt agreed that it was practiced in the Primitive times; for which they Quoted good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, but condemned their being uſed ill, either at the time of their Tranſportation from the Country where they were Bought to any other, or afterwards; and recommended that all Chriſtians ſhould Treat them, as having the Image of God; and uſe their beſt endeavours to inſtruct them in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. The covetouſneſs of moſt Commanders to Carry many to advance their Freight (for they are generally paid by the Head,) as it hath occaſioned unanſwerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes; ſo the death of abundance which ſhould be prevented if poſſible, that their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after Bought may be better then before; which may be the beſt Argument that can be given for the Buying and Selling of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Trades</hi> Settled in Joynt-Stocks muſt reſtrain the <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> from thence all Ships for the Carrying on of ſuch <hi>Trades</hi> muſt have their egreſs, and thither muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; which as well as the grievances before mentioned will occaſion complaints from the reſt of the Trading Towns: The City of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34988:70"/>
                     <hi>Exon</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and others being as well Seated and Accommodated for Carrying on a <hi>Trade</hi> for <hi>Africa,</hi> as <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The many diſcoveries that have been made of Countries and <hi>Trades,</hi> which now conſume great quantities of our Products, were always by bold Adventurers the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating of <hi>Trades</hi> in Joynt-Stocks, will be a diſcouragement and hinderance to ſuch undertakings; for as the Original of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations is from hopes of Gains, as we may Judge by the vaſt Sums of <hi>Mony</hi> that have been expended to procure <hi>Charters,</hi> and Support their Powers, ſo the way to make this Gain is to make uſe of that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (which is a conſequent of having a ſole <hi>Trade</hi>) to Deal Secure, Buy Cheap and Sell Dear; from which muſt follow Adventuring Little rather than much: If by 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Worths of Goods ſent to <hi>Guiny,</hi> when bought cheap and ſold dear they can get as much as by 40000 <hi>l.</hi> Bought and Sold at moderate Prices, they will to leſſen Adventures ſend only 20000 <hi>l.</hi> But this Method not is advantageous to the <hi>Nation,</hi> which depends upon the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of as many of our Goods to <hi>Africa,</hi> as can by any means be Conſumed there; and it is not likely that Companies will make bold Adventures to open New <hi>Trades.</hi> And it may be ſuſpected that the two <hi>Charters</hi> for the <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africa Trades,</hi> which Comprehend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one quarter Part of the World, and thoſe Places where it is moſt likely New and Beneficial <hi>Trades</hi> might be diſcovered,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34988:71"/>have been a great hinderance thereto; for notwithſtanding the many Flouriſhes that have been made to ingratiate, nothing of that kind hath appeared in effect to be done by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſaid Companies.</p>
                  <p>As long as we had Judges that were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Clauſes in theſe <hi>Charters</hi> were good in Law, and gave Judgments accordingly, no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was made to have theſe <hi>Trades</hi> ſettled by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but of late Petitions have been prefer'd for that purpoſe, and it has been propoſed that thoſe <hi>Trades</hi> ſhould be Settled in Joynt-Stocks for 21 Years; which it may be feared, would in effect, ſubject our beſt <hi>Trades,</hi> and our Treaſure to the Mercy of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and the <hi>Trade</hi> of our Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Mercy of an <hi>African</hi>-Company; and the variations and changes that uſually attend <hi>Trade,</hi> and the great Intereſt theſe Companies have for many Years made; by which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their Powers though Granted only by <hi>Charter,</hi> may be added as Arguments againſt Settling of thoſe <hi>Trades</hi> in Joynt-Stocks for 21 Years excluſie by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> leaſt whatever Miſchiefs or Inconvenienices. ſhould attend it, a new Settlement or alterations ſhould be found difficult or impoſſible to be attain'd.</p>
                  <p>As there is no preſident for ſettling Trades in Joint-Stocks by Act of Parliament for 21 Years, and a proſpect that may be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to the Publick, ſo improbable that ſuch a Settlement of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade ſhould prove Advantageous to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34988:71"/>excepting the Proprietors and Creditors of the Preſent Stock, to whom the Common Seal is indebted from 5 to 600000 <hi>l.</hi> upon Loans; for as 325565 <hi>l.</hi> of the Money paid in by the laſt New Adventurers was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken and applyed, to pay what was then owing on the Common Seal, which now lyes heavy on thoſe Adventurers, ſo either the 750000 <hi>l.</hi> which was lately propoſed to be ſubſcribed and paid in by the New Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, if thoſe Propoſals ſhould be reaſſumed and take effect, will be taken out immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and applyed for the payment of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney now owing, and ſo leave little or none to carry on the Trade; or if not paid, then muſt continue running on at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſo prove a gread load upon the New Adventurers; which added to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous Valuation of the Old Stock to which they muſt joyn their Money, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably deter all Perſons from adventuring; and then the conſequence of ſuch an Act will be, that the Trade will be ſecured to the preſent Adventurers for 21 Years longer, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily is chiefly deſigned. Whether any Act may be ſo made as to prevent theſe, and all other diſcouragements to New Adventurers, muſt be left to Time to diſcover. But as the great Reroute this Trade did get was by their great Dividends, which did ariſe from their confining their Stock to 372000 <hi>l.</hi> and Trading with 7 or 800000 <hi>l.</hi> of the Peoples Money, taken up at Low Intereſt, on a Common Seal; then doubling it, calling 100 <hi>l.</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:34988:72"/>200 <hi>l.,</hi> and ſelling it accordingly without bringing in any Money; by exciſing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by vertue of their Priviledges to have the ſole ſelling of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, and by ſuch additions as made; by their War on the <hi>Moguls</hi> Subjects, and Interlopers, or by Stock-Jobbing, Private Sales, Private Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though by ſuch Methods as theſe, great Gains have been made, which have put it out of diſpute that the Managers were a true Body Politick in Fact as well as in Name, yet happily, if ever this Trade ſhould be ſettled by Act of Parliament, ſuch a Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this may be exploded, and care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prevent the like for the future. And if Dividends ſhould be made hereafter on 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> inſtead of 372000 <hi>l.,</hi> and the Trade be ſo ſettled that the Gains ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe by what got from Foreigners, which can only inrich the Nation, and not ſo much out of our own people, which can only make Riches change hands. Such proviſions, and the incumbrances of the Debt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and high valuation of the Old Stock, will probably render ſuch a Settlement of this Trade in a Joint-Stock a grievance in a ſhort time, either to the New Members, if any come in, becauſe may not anſwer their expectation in point of Gains; or to others, not Members of the Company, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch care, extraordinary means to get Riches out of our own people ſhould be practiced as formerly; or to the Nation in general, if the Exportation of our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34988:72"/>
                     <hi>Coyn</hi> without limitation, and the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Manufactured Goods from <hi>India</hi> ſhould be permitted. Therefore it is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that ſuch a Settlement ſhould afford a general laſting ſatisfaction, as that a Houſe built on the Sand, or with ill tempered Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſhould be ſtrong. And the <hi>African</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being alſo indebted, and having followed much the pattern of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, the like difficulties may be ſuggeſted.</p>
                  <p>If our Neceſſities and Condition, as well as Reaſon, call upon us to ſettle Trade, as may be moſt for the advantage of the Nation, it will be in vain to think it can be done, as long as Arguments that have no ground but from particular Intereſts ſhall be allowed. Thoſe that are ingaged in any Profitable Trade will alwayes be loath to part with it, whatever Arguments may be given that it is Unprofitable to the Nation. Thoſe that are in poſſeſſion of any Charter, that conveyes to them a Trade excluſive to others, know it to be a great priviledge, and therefore will alwayes do their utmoſt to preſerve it to themſelves. Though the great Gains ſuch Corporations expect to make muſt be by ſqueezing and griping our own people, which though may inrich the Members of ſuch Companies, yet cannot tend to inrich the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Few Arguments can be given for incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the <hi>Eaeſt-India</hi> or <hi>Guinea</hi> Trades in Joint-Stocks, but what may be given for the incorporating of any Trade whatſoever, if
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34988:73"/>any aſſurance could be had that when Men are incorporated for the carrying on of a Trade, they would mind the publick more than their particular Intereſts, not extend their Powers to the prejudice of others, and be ſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine at a certain time, it would give ſome incouragement for ſuch Incorporations to be ſettled by Charters, or Acts of Parliament; but the contrary having appeared from time to time, that Private Intereſt hath over-ruled, without any regard to the Publick, or to the Laws of the Nation, or to Liberty or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that they have not only extended but prolonged their Powers, even when the perſons ſo Incorporated were untainted, as to their dealings in their private Capacities. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appears there cannot be any ſuch aſſurance, and therefore that unleſs for the incouraging of ſome New Invention, for a ſhort term of Years, the conſequence of ſetting up Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations muſt be dangerous, both in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the publick and particular perſons, a Common Seal having, as we may judge by what hath paſt, been taken as a ſhelter and protection for any illegal or unjuſt dealings, and a ſecurity againſt any Mans being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for what they may do, if act in a Body Corporate; the Power and Intereſt of moſt Corporations having rendered all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for ſatisfaction ineffectual, as too many have found by experience.</p>
                  <p>No good Argument that we muſt carry on theſe Trades by Companies in Joint-Stocks, becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> do thrive by it,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34988:73"/>and will get theſe Trades from us if not ſo ſettled.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company in <hi>Holland</hi> is ſo eſtabliſht, as that the Trade is not made a Property for ſome few Men, as hath been here, but the Benefits and Profits extenſive, and National, and the Trade not carryed on by the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> but their Gains is chiefly made by the Importation of <hi>Spices</hi> from <hi>Ceylon, Polleroon, Bantam,</hi> and other places which they have in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or where they have Factories under their own command. What Manufactured Goods they bring from <hi>India</hi> are moſt purchaſed by what they get, by imploying their Ships, and the Trade they drive in <hi>Spices,</hi> and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in thoſe parts, and the expence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Manufactured Goods not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged amongſt themſelves; it being affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they injoyn their Hangmen to wear <hi>Callicoe</hi> for their upper Veſtment, to diſparage the expence of them, that they, as well as their <hi>Spices</hi> and other Goods, may be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to other places to their great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage They ſend out Ships to carry neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the defence of their Plantations, and ſupply of their Factories, and to fetch home theſe Goods, but no conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Bullion.</hi> Their Strength in thoſe parts is ſo great, and ſo much exceeding ours in Ships and Men, that nothing but our Power here, can keep them in awe. They having got from us <hi>Amboyna, Polleroon, Bantam,</hi> and our Factories on the <hi>Spice</hi> Iſlands, have
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34988:74"/>got all that would be of uſe to them, and would not probably be at any Charge to get what we now have, unleſs to be rid of our Neighbourhood. And the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in <hi>Holland,</hi> which comprehends <hi>Africa,</hi> is alſo National and extenſive.</p>
                  <p>Though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that all the inconveniencies which have been mentioned will be prevented if ſettled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet the appropriating of 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> for the carrying on of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, if intended that ſuch a Stock in Money ſhall really be imployed in it, and the ſettling it for 21 Years without Limitations, as to the Exportation of <hi>Bullion,</hi> or Importation of Manufactured Goods, will yet make it lyable to many Objections: Therefore if it appear to better Judgments that this Trade cannot be ſecured or carried on, but by a Joint-Stock, it may be more adviſable ſo to ſettle it, as may beſt prevent the inconveniencies feared from the Trade it ſelf, by the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of too much <hi>Bullion,</hi> and Importation of Manufactured Goods to be conſumed here.</p>
                  <p>The prohibiting the expence of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured Goods and Toyes here, would very much leſſen the Exportation of our <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> eſpecially if we ſhould continue the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of ſending out for the carrying on of that Trade 100000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in our Goods, if not we ſhould be ſure of a good return for our <hi>Bullion</hi> by the Tranſportation of thoſe Goods to Foreign Markets, if none were allowed to be brought in but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34988:74"/>to be Exported again, and then a leſs Stock might ſerve for the carrying on of this Trade: And if two or three Ships the leſs ſhould then be imployed in that Trade, the Advantages we ſhall have in the conſumption of our Home-made <hi>Silks,</hi> and <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods, and in the increaſe of our <hi>Linnen</hi> Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would make us a ſufficient amends, the <hi>Druggs, Spices, Saltpetre,</hi> &amp;c. to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as formerly. And being few or no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments can be given for managing the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, in a Joint-Stock, which may not alſo be given for the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade, being alſo remote, and to an Infidel Country, and yet hath been carried on under a Regulated Company for a long ſucceſſion of time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any material Complaints. Whether theſe Heads for a Regulated Company, both for the Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>East-India,</hi> if thoſe under which the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade is now carried on be not found ſufficient, may not with ſome additions, alterations and amendments, be ſo improved as not to be lyable to the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies afore-mentioned, and yet ſerve for all the ends propoſed, where Companies are pretended to be neceſſary, for the carrying on of any Trade, is ſubmitted to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that are more intelligent in ſuch Affairs.</p>

That the ſaid Company, after the ſaid Stock is increaſed either by the ſaid Payments or Gains made thereon, having over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what may be thought neceſſary to pay and defray all publick Charges, ſhall make Dividends to the ſaid Members that paid in the ſaid Stock, to every one according to his reſpective proportion paid in, and time when ſuch Payments were made.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Maxims about Trade in Joynt-Stocks have had great Confirmation from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The firſt <hi>Charter</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Trade was Settled <hi>Anno</hi> 1600 for 15 Years; afterwards Four more, which did not prove in any reſpect uſeful to the <hi>Nation</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Trade; whatever advantages ſome particular Perſons might make by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of ſuch Stocks. After ſome courſe of Years all broke, to the Loſs of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in General, and prejudice of the Trade; for the Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> there have been
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34988:76"/>alſo the like number of <hi>Charters</hi> with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs: And it may appear upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when that Trade was open, near double the quantity of our Goods were ſent there, more then when Carried on by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Management of the late Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the <hi>Linnen</hi> Manufactury, <hi>Paper,</hi> making <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> and others, may be given as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to prove, that whatever Specious pretences may be made for Corporations whatever Advantages have been made by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons by Stock-Jobbing, or indirect ways, that few or none have ever yet proved Advantageous to the <hi>Nation;</hi> and if the Wayes and Means before mentioned, by which the preſent <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Company have Increaſed Trade, and made great Dividends be true, no good Arguments can be drawn from thence for erecting Corporations in Trade excluſive to others: And therefore if the Method propoſed for Regulated Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to Trade in ſuch Goods as may be thought convenient to be received from <hi>India,</hi> can be made practicable ſhould be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Joynt-Stocks, being the moſt probable way to make that Trade advantageous, it being poſſible that a Trade may be opened to <hi>China</hi> for the Expence of our Cloths, where great quantities if Introduced would be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and <hi>Gold</hi> is plenty; or from <hi>Gambroon</hi> to <hi>Perſia,</hi> being the Carriage of our Goods that way is not ſo Chargeable as from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> or to the Kingdom of <hi>Mindavo,</hi> or other Countries or Places, of which there are
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34988:77"/>great numbers in thoſe Parts, to which we have not yet Traded; or that we ſhould then fall into a way of Imploying our Ships in thoſe Parts, by Trading from Port to Port: The moſt likely way to make any clear Gains by that Trade, and the Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> under ſuch Regulations moſt likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Conſumption of our Goods in thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>The more hath been ſaid about theſe Trades, becauſe it is high time ſome Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were made of them, as may be moſt Advantageous for the <hi>Nation.</hi>

                  <p>No great Trading <hi>Nation</hi> can be at War with another <hi>Nation,</hi> but muſt undergo the diſadvantage of a Confederacy againſt their Trade. Hopes of making Gain by <hi>Privateer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> will draw all the Sea Vermin upon them from all Parts; and therefore where Fleets and ſingle Ships are many, Protection muſt be difficult, and yet ſo Eſſential, that without it Trade will have a quite contrary effect to what deſigned; for what is taken by Enemies will inrich them, and impoveriſh our Selves, but impoſſible to agree on any Scheme, but what muſt be ſubject to many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations and changes: Enemies may increſae their Strength and alter their Stations, and the going and coming of Fleets and Ships uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hard to be Regulated; Storms may occaſion ſeparations, and Winds and Weather a diſappointment to any thing that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; to which remedies muſt be applied, as ſuch Emergencies may require; but little hopes of a good effect, unleſs our Men of War be ſo provided or ordered, as that they may ſpend more time at Sea then in Port; and a Breach could be made upon the Methods our Enemies have taken to Ingroſs Intelligence. A conſtant Fleet of Men of War at the Chops of the <hi>Channel,</hi> and Guard Ships to ply about our Chief Head-lands and enterance to our Chiefeſt Ports, may force <hi>Privateers</hi> to look for their Prey further off at Sea, where they are not ſo ſure to meet it; to which the Carrying on of Trade by Fleets, and thoſe Protected by good Convoys may be a further ſecurity.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34988:78"/>Protraction of time for the departure of Convoys; whether occaſioned by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Ships, or Convoys not being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath occaſioned great Loſſes, and ſhould be prevented if poſſible: Our <hi>Steights</hi> and Plantation Trades being remote, will always require a particular care, and great Strength to the diminiſhing of our Convoys for other Parts. How to ſecure all is a matter of ſo great difficulty, that it may be much eaſier to find Fault, then provide effectual remedies, though of all things the moſt deſirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Trade; and therefore Neceſſary to be conſidered by our greateſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.<note place="margin">Book of Rates.</note>

As the peruſal and new Settling of it, might be a great eaſe to Trade without any diminution to the Kings Cuſtoms; ſo by it much might be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Regulation of Trade, by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diminiſhing the Duties; and if ſome recompence could be found that the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now Paid on our Manufactures, and Products Exported might be taken off, and none Paid for the future, would occaſion the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34988:78"/>increaſe of the Export and Conſumption of them; for though the Duty be not great, yet being an addition to the firſt Coſt, and paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Adventures born it is a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Exportation, and that addition to the coſt is ſome hinderance to the Conſumption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Commanders of our Merchant Ships and Seamen, had formerly ſo great a repute for their Courage and Integrity, that all Foreign <hi>Nations</hi> did covet to imploy them which was of great Advantage to us; but much declined before this War, if not Loſt, other <hi>Nations</hi> getting the preference. The Cauſe imputed to the Debauchery, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of our Seamen, which rendered them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be truſted, in the opinion of thoſe that had occaſion to imploy them. The reducing them to good order and Sobriety, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our Credit with Foreign <hi>Nations,</hi> would be of great uſe; for what ſo gotten would be clear Profit, and the Imployment ſo given to Ships and Seamen, an increaſe to both.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that Laws for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of Trade are unneceſſary,<note place="margin">Laws ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary jor Regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Trades.</hi>
                     </note> if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, and that it had better be left to take its own Courſe; but this opinion hath
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34988:79"/>been contradicted by Experience; and if it ſhould be allowed, as a General Rule, will upon inquiry be found lyable to many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                  <p>Merchants and Traders, in carrying on their Trades, have regard chiefly to their own Intereſt, whether their Gains ariſe by what they Export, and ſell Abroad, which can only tend to inrich the Nation, or out of our own people, by what Imported, and ſold dear to them, though ſpent in Luxury, which may impoveriſh the Nation, hath not hitherto been thought their province to mind.</p>
                  <p>If the management of all Trades be left to diſcretion, without reſtraints or incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Laws, no doubt but that the Traders will be careful to purſue thoſe that afford them moſt Gains, with diligence and induſtry, but it is probable decline thoſe where cannot have ſuch expectations for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though afford a proſpect of Gains to the Nation. More of Real Riches may be acquired by the Fiſhing Trades than by others that may appear more glorious; but thoſe will be moſt followed that afford moſt Gains to particular perſons, unleſs Authority inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and afford help, as there may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>If a <hi>Merchant</hi> can by ſending out 20000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Bullion,</hi> bring any ſorts of Goods home that may ſell for 40000 <hi>l.,</hi> the <hi>Merchant</hi> may by ſuch an Adventure get 20000 <hi>l.</hi> to himſelf, and yet the 20000 <hi>l.</hi> ſent out in <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> may be ſo much loſt to the Nation;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34988:79"/>unleſs ſuch Goods be proper for a further Manufactury, or to be Exported.</p>
                  <p>Some Traders have made great Gains by diminiſhing the Length, Breadth, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of ſome of our Staple Commodities, which cannot be gotten by any ſuch contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance without a great hazard of loſs to the Nation, becauſe its probable the expence of ſuch Goods will decline upon a detection of ſuch Abuſes.</p>
                  <p>As the Act of <hi>Navigation</hi> hath been in many reſpects advantageous, ſo other Laws might have prevented what we have ſuffered by the <hi>French</hi> Trade, and the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we lye under by the preſent management of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Trades; which with other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that might be given, would make it clear that without a continuance or reaſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Care in the Government, Trade will lye open, and be expoſed to the incroachment of Foreigners, and our own people; and that it is high time now to take it into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, becauſe moſt of the Laws that have been made relating to Trade, ſince the Act of <hi>Navigation,</hi> may be preſumed were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated rather for particular Intereſts than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good; more to advance ſome Tradeſmen than the Trade of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>If the meaning of leaving Trade to take its own courſe, be limited to Trades carried on by the Exportation of our Products and Manufacturies, not lyable to any great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as it relates to that only; for the Care of the Government will then only be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34988:80"/>neceſſary how to incourage, promote and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch Trade that it may continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; but if our Importations, Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Home, and the Exportation of <hi>Coyn</hi> or <hi>Bullion</hi> be left at liberty, we may drive a great Trade, and yet in the end be found loſers by it. As many particular perſons have Traded away their Eſtates, and been reduced to Poverty, by Buying, Selling and Trading (without any Loſſes at Sea), ſo a Nation may exhauſt their Treaſure, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Poor by Trade, unleſs Care be taken to prevent it. If all Trades ſhould be left to take their courſe till they mend themſelves, we may be reduced to a low ebb before that may happen; for in moſt Caſes, nothing but our Poverty and Inability, longer to ſupport a bad Trade, like to occaſion any ſuch change.</p>
                  <p>As too many Limitations of Trade may be inconvenient, ſo too much Liberty dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. After an exact inquiry into the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate of Trade, upon which the ſtate of the Nation doth much depend, good Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, good Examples, and good Laws, will be found neceſſary for the putting of bounds to the prodigal expence of Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and increaſe of pernicious Trades; otherwayes ſome Trades will prove to the Body Politick, as a Canker or Conſumption to the Body Natural</p>
                  <p>If the ſtate of our Trade in <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods,<note place="margin">The decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtate of our Woollen Goods.</note> which is of the greateſt importance to us, be conſidered, there will be found great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34988:80"/>to fear that it is on the declining hand, as well occaſioned by the alteration of Habits, and Faſhious, in ſeveral Countries, which hath brought in the uſe and expence of more <hi>Silk</hi> than formerly, to which our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples have contributed, as alſo becauſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturies of <hi>Wooll</hi> are ſet up in <hi>Ireland, Portugal, France, Germany,</hi> and other places, which threaten the deſtruction of ours. Upon an inquiry it will appear that few <hi>Merchants</hi> have inricht themſelves by the Exportation of our <hi>Woollen</hi> Goods or Products for theſe 30 Years paſt, though they have been Exported in great abundance, yet rather out of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to imploy Ships or to provide Effects, than out of Choice; and that their chief hopes hath been, that Goods brought Home would ſell dear, and that they ſhould thereby make their profit, and ſo have made their Gains out of our own People, and not out of Foreigners; which as to the Nation makes a great alteration in Trade: For though we have thus been provided with what we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Abroad, yet ſo coſtly to us as that our Riches have been impaired thereby.</p>
                  <p>The great Loſſes we have had by Sea in theſe Seven Years War with <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ways and means to increaſe our riches</note> will not be recovered without more than ordinary Care. If a great Stock be abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to carry on a great Trade, we may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conclude, that the Stock of this Nation is ſo diminiſhed, that it will fall ſhort; and that without Prudence, Induſtry, and good Husbandry, we ſhall rather confume what is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34988:81"/>left, than recover what we have loſt. No particular Perſon, nor Nation, was ever fettled upon any foundation ſo ſecure, but might deſtroy themſelves. We ought not to conclude we ſhall be Rich, and Happy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no. Care and trouble is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to all Men, the greateſt Nations having in all Ages been ſubject to Mutations and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of Fortune, either by their own folly and ill management, or becauſe the Race is not alwayes to the ſwift, nor Battle to the ſtrong; but as Proſperity hath uſually made Men careleſs, ſo Adverſity ought to make them ſerious, and caſt about how they may mend their condition. If upon an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it be found that we have walked in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct paths, and thereby, or by misfortune, conſumed or loſt much of our Treaſure, Stock and Trade, and brought our ſelves into a precarious condition, it will be in vain to continue in the ſame, and longer depend upon ſandy foundations, and neglect to uſe ſuch means as are in our power to eſtabliſh us in a better; it appearing by the new Coyning of our Money, and by the Trades we yet drive, and great Fleets we have, that there is not only an Ability in the Nation, but alſo a Spirit in the People, which if cultivated, improved and incouraged, by proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, might be ſufficient to attain that end. Nothing more convenient than that good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions upon ſolid Conſultations ſhould be taken in order thereto.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:34988:81"/>
                  <p>Such Obſervations as theſe,<note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home.</note> upon matters relating to Trade, and upon ſeveral other Trades we drive to other Countries, might be inlarged; but if theſe hinted at, appear to be the moſt material, and ſufficient to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a more exact inquiry, no more was deſigned, leaſt ſhould divert too much from looking into what is of great importance in order to amend our Condition, our Trade, Practices and Oeconomy, at Home.</p>
                  <p>For it will be difficult, if not impoſſible, to retrieve what we have loſt, or be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht in a good condition for the future, by any Settlement, or Lawes that can be made in reference to our Foreign Trades, unleſs the Genious of our People, courſe of Living, and Management, can be ſo changed as to cooperate therewith: Not uſing proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to get, or conſuming Riches aſſoon as got, will render all endeavours of that kind ineffectual. As Idleneſs, and the tranſports of Luxury, have brought us into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo the contrary practices moſt likely to afford us a cure.</p>
                  <p>If the original of our moveable Riches muſt be from Labour, Induſtry, and Foreign Trade, and the way to keep and retain Riches, when got, muſt be by good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, in the conſumption and expence of the Goods of Foreign Nations, and in all our Dealings with them, no reformation can be propoſed, that can do us any good, but what muſt begin amongſt our ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:34988:82"/>
                  <p>Though ſeveral ſorts of Trades and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments muſt be allowed, as well for the ſupport of the Publick as for private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, yet a great difference ſhould be made between ſuch Trades and Imployments that in their nature and deſign tend to get and bring Riches into the Nation, and thoſe that can only ſerve to make it change hands; for when ſuch Trades are increaſed to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and numerous, they will prove a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to thoſe Trades that are moſt ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to bring it in, by drawing off both Stock and People. If to maintain vain and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Cuſtoms and Habits, 1000 Perſons be imployed (inſtead of 500, that would do as well for what is neceſſary) as in many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions might be inſtanced, then 500 of the 1000 inſtead of being uſeful to the Nation, muſt live by preying, pilfering or ſpunging upon other Mens Labours. The new Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings about <hi>London</hi> have occaſioned the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great numbers of People out of the Country, where they were very neceſſary and uſeful, to live in <hi>London</hi> upon ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and indirect ways: For it may be difficult to give an inſtance where any great numbers of Artificers or Manufacturers are ſet up in thoſe Buildings, excepting in <hi>Spittle-Fields</hi> and places adjacent, where ſuch did formerly inhabit.</p>
                  <p>That great Eſtates have been gotten of late Years, and that perſons of all degrees live more ſplendid and expenſive than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, cannot be any proof that our
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34988:82"/>Riches are increaſed, unleſs it did alſo appear that ſuch Eſtates had been acquired by the Exportation of our Products and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturies, and Gains made on them, or by ſome other profitable ingagements with Foreigners. If gotten at Home amongſt our ſelves, then it could not add too, nor diminiſh the Stock of the Nation, though might occaſion a great alteration in the Fortunes of particular Men. A prodigal expenſive way of Living is a proof that a Nation hath ſome Stock and Riches; but as all extravagant Expences have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to exhauſt the treaſure of a Nation, ſo ought rather to create a ſuſpicion that ſuch a Nation muſt grow Poor, than afford any Argument that therefore muſt be Rich.</p>
                  <p>The Millions of Money gotten by farming the Revenues, Advantages taken in receiving and paying the Publick Money, and by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other wayes unknown in former Ages, as it occaſioned the giving of great Supplyes, which hath fallen hard upon the people, to make good what was thus gotten out of the Publick Incomes, and diverted to private uſes, ſo when <hi>Land</hi> could not well bear the Charge, was levied by ſeveral Impoſitions on <hi>Trade,</hi> which as they have been, ſo ever will be (as long as they are continued) a load upon ſome Foreign Trades; ſo the drawing of ſuch great Sums of Money out of its right channel, hath made a great alteration in the imploying of the Stock of the Nation, and of the People: For though Impoſitions on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34988:83"/>Trade are in effect but a charging Land, or Landed Men, by another name, at leaſt with the greateſt proportion of what ſo charged, yet being the Traders are firſt to pay it, and ſuch Impoſitions have alwayes been found troubleſome, and a hinderance to Trade, and ſo a diminution of their Profits, they will alwayes think themſelves moſt concerned therein.</p>
                  <p>If upon an inquiry into the uſefulneſs of the ſeveral Orders, Ranks, Degrees and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of Men, it appears that Merchants, Tradeſmen and Seamen, and ſuch as are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed under them, that carry on our Foreign Trades, Husbandmen, and ſuch as are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed under them, to make the Products of the Earth uſeful, are chiefly thoſe that can be a means to bring in Riches, or to provide Neceſſaries for the ſupport of a Nation; then nothing can be more neceſſary and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial than to uſe all means to incourage and increaſe ſuch, and to diſcover what Trades and Imployments are practiced that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and uſeleſs, that they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or rather diſcharged, as a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous burthen and a load upon the Nation; leaſt ſuch, like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine, ſhould in time deſtroy thoſe that are good.</p>
                  <p>As the Imployment and good Management of our People muſt be the way to get Riches, ſo good Husbandry in our Dealings with Foreign Nations will be found the beſt and ſureſt way to preſerve and retain them. The expence and conſumption of ſuch Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34988:83"/>as have, and are alwayes like to be, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with our Money ſhould in the firſt place be taken care of, that we may have as few of ſuch as may conſiſt with our Safety and Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the continuance of Trade depends much upon a mutual conveniency, but the advantage and increaſe of Riches, expected by Trade, depends upon our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting more Goods than we Import; to which nothing can conduce ſo much as the making at home as many ſorts of Goods as is poſſible, or having them from Foreign parts for Tranſportation, ſo cheap and good as that they may be preferred by, and ſold to Foreigners by us, before the Goods of ſuch other Nations as are our Competitors; and the ſpending of no more of our own Goods, or of thoſe we bring from Foreign parts, at home than our neceſſities require, is the beſt way to run little in Debt to Foreign Nations; for then we may either bring the leſs, or have the more to Tranſport to Foreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets All prodigality at home in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Commodities that are fit for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Markets, is in effect a conſuming of ſo much of the Treaſure of the Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe would yield and produce Treaſure (more or leſs) if it were not ſo conſumed; from which it may be concluded, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more dangerous to reduce a Nation to Poverty than an unlimited, vain, prodigal way of Living, ſo impoſſible to propoſe any way to recover and inrich a Nation, next
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34988:84"/>to Labour and Induſtry, like frugality and Parſimony. Labour and Induſtry muſt be the way to bring it in, and Frugality and Parſimony the only way to keep and retain it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if we deſign to be rich we muſt alter our Courſe of Living, Oeconomy and diſpoſition of affairs at home, that induſtry may be promoted and extravagancies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that we may increaſe our good Trades, and leſſen our Expences, and then we ſhall ſoon find that the Ballance will be brought to ſtand in our favour; but to get little and ſpend much, will be ſure to have the quite contrary effect.</p>
                  <p>Our Landed Men ſhould reform their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved appetites, and be content to be ſerved with their own products, inſtead of coſtly varieties from abroad, which hath of late Years Swoln the Expences of many beyond their due proportions; this they would ſoon find (as their Anceſtors did) to be their true Intereſt, though the Conſumption of coſtly Foreign Commodities hath too much alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the <hi>Annual</hi> expences of the Trading People; yet they may make themſelves ſome amends at the end of the Year by what may have got by the increaſe of their Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick in ſuch Luxurious Commodities: But the Landed Men cau have no ſuch proſpect, nor of any good return; they do not only impair their Eſtates by ſuch Expences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of advantage, but are thereby the chief incouragers of ſuch Trades as abate
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34988:84"/>the Value of their Rents and Products, which could not be carryed on ſo much to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and impoveriſhing of the <hi>Nation</hi> without their help, in the Conſumption of ſuch Commodities. As we have good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the ſupply of Nature, ſo good <hi>Silks, Cloths,</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> of our own make for all uſes; which ought to be eſteemed, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and deſpiſed, becauſe do not come from <hi>France,</hi> or ſome Foreign Country; and we had better keep our old Faſhions, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Invent better then imitate thoſe of Foreign <hi>Nations</hi> to our deſtruction. Such alterations as theſe in our Courſe of Living, would ſoon alter the Courſe of Trade for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for when Traders may not find it ſo eaſie to get <hi>Mony</hi> out of our own people by what bring from abroad, and Sell here at home, will then be under a neceſſity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their thoguhts how to get <hi>Mony</hi> from Foreigners, and to apply themſelves to Store their Shops and Ware-Houſes with ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as may have that effect. The chief end deſigned by Trade, was to make us Rich, not Extravagant: by diminiſhing the expence of thoſe Commodities: By which we Loſe, we ſhall increaſe the Making of thoſe by which we get; all which may be done without abating much of our State and Grandeur (But in opinion:) as the Ballance of <hi>England</hi> lyes in <hi>Land,</hi> ſo the Ballancing of Trade lyes in the <hi>Landed</hi> Men; a power very fit for them at this time to aſſume, as well for the Publick as their Private Intereſt, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34988:85"/>may not longer ſubmit the direction of their expences, and ſo conſequently their Eſtates to thoſe that Serve them; who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of keeping them up to unintelligible niceties in points of Gallantry, as to Modes and Faſhions, in a courſe of Years get their <hi>Lands</hi> for payments of Bills ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, which hath proved the ruin of many antient Families, though by a turn in Fancy and Humour might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. As have hitherto been too Fond of ſpending Goods that come from abroad, if would now reſolve to ſpend what are made at Home, would cultivate an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit in our People to improve their Art in the Making of them; which Spur'd on by emulation and Intereſt, would in a ſhort time come to ſuch perfection as that we might be in hopes to have the advantage hereafter, of Furniſhing thoſe <hi>Nations</hi> with our Goods, who have hitherto Furniſhed us: It having been a great diſcouragement to our Manufacturers to ingage heartily in the Making of them hitherto, to find them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and deſpiſed, only becauſe they were of our own Make, though equal (if not Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in goodneſs) to thoſe from abroad. The difficulties we are under, and the Loſſes we now ſuſtain only for want of a Currency to the <hi>Coyn</hi> we have, may afford us a proſpect in what a Condition we ſhall be, if by our own folly and Extravagancies, we ſhould conſume what we have now left, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a perpetual ſcarcity of it, or at leaſt for a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34988:85"/>long time; it being a Commodity that may ſoon be ſpent, but not eaſily recovered: Certainly we had better Practice good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry out of choice in order to preſerve what we have, then be forced to it out of neceſſity hereafter in hopes to regain it; for if ever we ſhould be reduced to ſuch a want of <hi>Coyn,</hi> we ſhall ſoon find our Selves under the difficulties repreſented by this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb.<note n="*" place="margin">In a Houſe where there are many People and little Bread all will be cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all with a great deal of Reaſon.</note>

                  <p>As we ought to make a Reformation in our Courſe of Living, ſo ſuch alterations in our Trades as before mentioned, or ſuch as may be propoſed by thoſe who have better Judgments. We ſhould Conſider how long our Stock of Mony may hold out before we permit it to be Exported to Carry on Trades as hitherto. The expence here at Home of Manufactured Goods, and Toyes from <hi>India</hi> ſhould be prohibited, and that Trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34988:86"/>to its former Eſtabliſhment, as it was Carryed on <hi>Anno</hi> 1666, and Limited as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to export only 40 or 50000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in <hi>Bullion,</hi> at moſt not to exceed 100000 <hi>l.</hi> which happily will be found upon an inquiry to be near as much as can be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally made out, was ever brought back to us in <hi>Bullion</hi> by thoſe Goods Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Foreign Parts; for though a much greater value have been always <hi>Annnally</hi> Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet it may be a Queſtion if we ever had more returned in <hi>Bullion,</hi> or any great advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thereby, being ſome have hinder'd the Exportation as well as Conſumption of our own Fabricks, and others have always been Exchanged for other Commodities abroad, to be ſpent here in Luxury. As it cannot be denyed that the great quantities of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured Goods brought here from <hi>India,</hi> do hinder the Conſumption of the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Manufactured Goods of <hi>Europe;</hi> So it may be made out that we have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Share by the Loſs occaſioned by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſuch Goods. If we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſending out our <hi>Wooll</hi> to be Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad, whither the Goods made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be ſpent here, or in Foreign Parts, to the hindrance of our own <hi>Woollen</hi> Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we ſhall Loſe about 8 Parts in 10, of what we might have made of our <hi>Wooll</hi> if had been Manufactured here, and not much leſs by fending our <hi>Mony</hi> to Buy <hi>Silks</hi> or <hi>Linnens,</hi> when we might be ſupplied at Home, or in return of our own Manufacturies, as long
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34988:86"/>as thoſe great and ſubtil abilities which have been Conſpicuous this laſt Age, are wholly applied, and with ſucceſs, to get Eſtates by the late invented Trades of Stock-jobbing, or Preying on the Publick Incomes, or other Mens Labours, and ſuch other Contrivances as have of late been too much practiced at Home; and there be no great endeavours uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and protect ſuch Trades as may gain and procure us Wealth from abroad, incourage our own Manufacturies, and to diſcourage thoſe that occaſion the Exportation of our <hi>Coyn.</hi> We may as well hope to make the <hi>Nation</hi> Rich by geting Mony out of the Clouds, as by Trade.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that may underſtand ſuch Notions and Propoſitions as theſe, to be penurious, malicious, diſhonourable, or a ſtinting of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Trade, ſhould at the ſame time offer others more likely to be effectual; for it will be but little Comfort to us, if our Enemies ſhould come upon us, to be found Jovial, Gallant, Idle, divided in opinions or minding particular Intereſt more then the Publick; but in no Condition to defend our Selves. The alterations which have happened of late Years in the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> ought to exert our beſt thoughts how to prevent the Miſchiefs that Threaten our Trade and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We formerly looked on the <hi>Dutch</hi> as out only Rivals; now the <hi>French</hi> by their indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Induſtry to promote Trade, and by their additions made to their Strength at Sea appear more dangerous; and though we may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34988:87"/>hope that our peace with <hi>Holland</hi> may long continue, yet we ought to be provided to conteſt with both if occaſion be given; for what hath been, may be again. As our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Charge and Expence is like to be much greater for the future to preſerve the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as well as Trade, ſo a good and ſure Foundation ſhould be laid for the ſupporting of it. As the <hi>French</hi> have found their ends in promoting of Trade, ſo it is probable that after this War is over will apply themſelves Induſtriouſly to increaſe theirs, and decreaſe ours: and we may be aſſured that their greateſt Councils will give their utmoſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the minuteſt Projects of that kind, and that no Craft, Coſt nor endeavours will be ſpared, not only to undermine us in the Carrying on of any Manufacturies here at Home that may prejudice theirs, but alſo to hinder our Foreign Trade by their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in the Courts of all Princes, where there may be grounds for any ſuch attempt: As this War hath exhauſted their Treaſure, they having no Mines of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> have no way to repleniſh their Stores but by Trade, Rapine or Conqueſt, nothing more likely to keep them Poor, then the continuance of a Confederacy againſt ſpending of their Goods; to which the long diſuſe of them, Enmity and Jealouſies they have by this War Contracted may conduce; alſo the retrieving of our <hi>Fiſhing</hi> Trades, and the Increaſing of the <hi>Silk, Linnen, Paper,</hi> and other Commodities here, upon which their Trade doth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34988:87"/>may have a good effect. Our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for our preſervation ſhould be adequate in all Circumſtances to our dangers, which appear great. As Fleets and Armies ſhould be minded, ſo Debaucheries and Immoralities ſhould be diſcouraged, becauſe have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to Weakneſs and Deſtruction, and to the drawing of Gods Judgments upon us; it being in vain to ſuppoſe <hi>that he that made the Eye doth not ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuch Conſiderations as theſe deſerve to be handled by ſome abler Pen, that more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Remonſtrances, and more ſenſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may be made, to excite us to a due conſideration of our ways, and to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on our ſelves before things come to the laſt extremity; which though ſhould carry ſome appearance of ſharpneſs, would yet be ſtrokes of real kindneſs, that we may throw off thoſe inchantments and infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have too long predominated, and have recourſe to proper methods to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us in a good condition, to ſecure our ſelves againſt all attempts that may be made by our Enemies; for if we could abandon our Paſſions, and break the meaſures we have taken againſt our ſelves, we ſhould ſoon break thoſe our Enemies have taken againſt us, and prevent our ſinking under the great weight that lyes upon us. If Vertue, Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, good Husbandry, and Sobriety, could regain their Empire amongſt us, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments (the chief ſupporters of Government) a due diſtribution, before
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34988:88"/>we make nearer approaches to deſtroy all truſt and confidence as to our Dealings one with another, then we ſhould ſee the Riches we have applyed to the operations moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and afford ſuch an increaſe as might Reaſonably be expected; but Luxury and its inſeparable Companions, Idlenefs, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, Immoralities and Corruptions, as have formerly reduced great Nations to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Weakneſs, and laid their Glory in the duſt, ſo we may juſtly fear that the ſame cauſe may produce with us the ſame effects, and that without a univerſal change in our courſe of Living and Practices, all good expected by Laws of any kind, and all the endeavours of our Superiours, will be in danger to be defeated; it being impoſſible that they ſhould, have the effect of making us Rich or Happy, as long as the generality will conſpire and combine to make the Nation poor and miſerable. But the many Miſtakes and Imperfections in this Treatiſe may juſtly occaſion that the Author be cenſured for having adventured too far already, and that went out of his Trade when undertook this Task: But it being not deſigned to impoſe or miſlead, but chiefly to provoke others of more Judgment and Experience in matters of Coyn, and Mercantile Affairs, to offer their Thoughts; being Subjects of ſo much nicety, that few agree in Notions relating to them, and yet of ſo great importance that nothing can more conduce to the inriching of the Nation, then
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34988:88"/>that they ſhould be ſettled on the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous and laſting foundations, agreeable to the Rules of Prudence, Honour and Juſtice; therefore it is hoped, that they that have more Ability will correct the Matter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavouring to correct the Author, who hath taken this pains only in hopes it may be of ſome uſe to the Publick, without any deſign againſt Mens particular Intereſts, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as ſuch Intereſts were underſtood to be deſtructive to the common good; for if we could agree what is our true Intereſt, in reference to the Publick, and to ſacrifice our Paſſions and private Intereſts thereto, then by Gods Bleſſing on our endeavours we may hope to retrieve our Trade; but if inſtead thereof we ſhould continue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in Luxury, and ſcrambling who ſhall get moſt one from another, it may be feared we ſhall indanger the loſs of all, and juſtly incur the Sentence pronounced by the Wiſe Man, <hi>He that is in love with his folly, ſhall periſh in it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this the Plaintiff hath demurr'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I come to ſtate the Points and Queſtions, upon which this Queſtion truly depends; I deſire to ſhew what are not the Points or Queſtions in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not the Queſtion, whether the King, by Law, can reſtrain any of his Subjects to go out of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>For the King may ſo do, and this without Diſtinction of Chriſtian or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Country, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not the Queſtion, whether the King can reſtrain all his Subjects to ſuch a Country or City.</p>
                  <p>It may be done upon particular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as of War or Plague.</p>
                  <p>But from hence to argue, that the King can grant you and your Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors for ever, a ſole Trade to ſuch a Country or Place, excluding all other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34988:94"/>his Subjects, except with your Leave or Licence: Becauſe he can reſtrain this or that Subject, therefore he can grant a ſole Trade to the Plaintiff, and exclude all others, but you, and ſuch as you, licence for ever: Becauſe he can, upon particular Occaſions, as of War or Plague, reſtrain or prohibit his Subjects to go or trade to ſuch a City or Country: That when there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plague nor War, the King ſhould grant a ſole Trade to any particular Perſon, whether Body Politick or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and reſtrain all others for ever.</p>
                  <p>Can this be by the Law done?</p>
                  <p>If this Foundation will warrant it, though in this Caſe this be with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; and upon that ground, ſome difference imagined betwixt an Infidel and a Chriſtian Country: Yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your Reaſon or Foundation doth not diſtinguiſh or make a Difference.</p>
                  <p>For if becauſe the King hath Power to reſtrain or prohibit Subjects to go out of the Realm: Or by Occaſion of War or Plague, all his Subjects from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch a City or Country; ſince this Power (you muſt agree) extends as well to Chriſtian as Infidel City or Country;</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:34988:95"/>
                  <p>The granting of ſole Trade to one Subject or Body Politick, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others, is the ſame; whether it be to Chriſtian or Infidel City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>And when you cite the of Statute 3 <hi>Jacc.</hi> 6. which enacts,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the King's Subjects ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trade to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Charters of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration granted to ſome Merchants, and the Prohibitions in thoſe Charters:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from thence argue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were Prohibitions or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints by Charters, as to thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which were Chriſtian, therefore ſuch a ſole Trade to an Infidel Country is well granted:</p>
                  <p>You muſt have it admitted, that ſuch a Grant to thoſe Countries is good and legal; or elſe you argue from that which you grant not to be lawful, to prove another like Grant to be lawful. Or at leaſt by the ſame Arguments and Reaſons maintain ſuch a Grant of ſole Trade to be good, whether made to Chriſtian or Infidel Country.</p>
                  <p>If then it not being the Point or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in this Caſe,</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34988:95"/>
                  <p>Whether the King can reſtrain his Subjects from going beyond the Seas? Nor,</p>
                  <p>Whether the King can lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain his Subjects to trade to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Country or Place, whether Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Infidel?</p>
                  <p>Then the Queſtions plainly and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether this Grant of ſole Trade to the Plaintiffs, be a good Grant or not?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing that it ſhould be, then whether this Action be maintainable or not?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Common Law, Trade is free and open for the King's Subjects. And this I ſhall endeavour to ſhew from Authorities.</p>

                  <p>For the Conſequence of it muſt be, that they would ſell at their own Price, and thereby exact upon the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

                  <p>And for the latter Part of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any Perſon is reſtrained or hindred in his Liberty,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Patent grants to you to ſeize the Ships and Goods of any that come thither.</p>
                  <p>And your bringing this Action, ſhews you are ſufficiently a Hinderer of the Liberty of others to trade.</p>
                  <p>So that I think you can't deny but that you are comprehended under this Deſcription.</p>
                  <p>But for further Evidence of its being a Monopoly, let us ſee what the Evils and Miſchiefs are that were in Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies which the Law ſpeaks ſo hard of.</p>
                  <p>The Evils and Miſchiefs are:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Price of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity they ſell, ſhall be kept and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34988:99"/>riſen higher than otherwiſe it would be.</p>
                  <p>For, he that hath the ſole Trade, will keep up the Price as he pleaſeth. And this is one of the Evils mentioned in the Caſe of Monopolies, 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 86. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Truth hereof I think is evident enough, and no Man in Reaſon thinks but he that hath the ſole Trade, trades for his Advantage: And the higheſt and deareſt Rates he can ſell at, and the cheapeſt he can buy at, are his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Miſchief or Evil is, that Monopolies or ſole Trade is <hi>pro privato paululorum quaeſtu.</hi> So it is ſaid to be in the Margent of the Book before cited, 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 181.</p>
                  <p>No Man will doubt hereof, that conſiders the preſent State or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Company.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another Evil or Miſchief of Monopolies or ſole Trade, is the Impoveriſhment and Oppreſſion of the King's Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Trade is not in its own Nature fix'd and ſtable, but varying and altering, ſometimes better, ſometimes worſe. Sometimes one Trade beneficial, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34988:100"/>not; according as Wares, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Scarſity of this or that ſort of Commodity or Merchandize in this or that Country; Modes, Faſhions, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Habits of Men do occaſion.</p>
                  <p>And the Merchants, by their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Obſervation, manage and govern this Trade, for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of themſelves and their Families, and the general Good of Men. And direct and imploy their Eſtates, and traffick into this or that Part of the World, as Time and Occaſion ſhall give them beſt Encouragement.</p>
                  <p>But ſole Trade into this or that Part of the World, granted to one Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and of another to another, ſets up the particular Men that head the Companies, but deſtroys all other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and inferior People.</p>
                  <p>Such Patents muſt undo all other Parts of this Kingdom beſides <hi>London.</hi> For, the Companies can't drive theſe great Trades, but muſt manage them in <hi>London,</hi> and conſequently, the other Parts of the Kingdom, muſt be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. All ſhipping muſt be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Rates and Prizes theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators of Trade will give them;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34988:100"/>or elſe lye ſtill and be deſtroyed. And ſo muſt all Maſters of Ships, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; all Artificers, Labourers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and Servants, whoſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depend upon theſe Trades, muſt all be ſubjected to their Wills.</p>
                  <p>And of how great Conſequence that may be, deſerves Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtances of your Oppreſſions and Dealings with your Factors, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Servants, and Seamen that got any thing in their Service, are well known.</p>
                  <p>So that if the Evils and Miſchiefs which the Common Law forbids and endeavours to prevent, by judging all Monopolies, Ingroſſings, and ſole Trade unlawful, be to be avoided; The Evils and Miſchiefs attending your Patent and ſole Trade, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the greateſt, becauſe your ſole Trade is the greateſt that ever <hi>England</hi> knew.</p>
                  <p>That every Grant of the King hath this Condition implied in it,<note place="margin">F. N. Br 222.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. Quod Patria per talem donationem magis ſolito non oneretur ſeu gravetur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grant le Roy al charge ou prejudice del Subject est void.</hi>

                  <p>And if the Evils and Miſchiefs of this Grant be as I have ſtated them; 'Tis a Grant to the Oppreſſion and Prejudice of the Subject: And therefore the King is deceived in it, and the Grant by the common Law void, as I have before ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But perhaps it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that this Patent is granted for good Government and Order, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this Trade, which will otherwiſe be deſtroyed, and for the Good of the Kingdom: And there have been in all Times ſuch Patents, as to <hi>Turky, Barbary, Guiny,</hi> and others.</p>

                  <p>And there alſo it appears, and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, that <hi>Darcie</hi>'s Patent had a glorious Preamble, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Subjects might exerciſe their Husbandry and lawful Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not be corrupted to Idleneſs by the wicked thing called Cards, the ſole Sale and Trade of Cards is granted to <hi>Darcey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve, ſays the Book, what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preamble and Pretext this odious Monopoly had.</p>
                  <p>That Patent which (made 3 Years after this,<note place="margin">Horn and Ivy, Mich. 20. B. 2. c. 403.</note> and dated 17 of <hi>March,</hi> 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. in Imitation of this) erected the <hi>Canary</hi> Company, and granted them the ſole Trade, Recites, That the Trade to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> was of greater Advantage to the King's Subjects formerly, than at that Time: That by reaſon the too much Acceſs and Trading of Subjects thither, our Merchandizes were decreaſed in their Value, and the Wines increaſed to double Value; ſo that the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were forced to carry Silver and Bullion there to get Wines.</p>
                  <p>And that all this happened for want of Regulation of Trade.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34988:102"/>And thereupon the Patent conſtituted Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram,</hi> and about 60. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more by Name, and all others of the King's Subjects, Merchants or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, trading, or that had within ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years, traded to thoſe Iſlands, to the Value of 1000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and all others that after ſhould be admitted ſhould be a Body Politick.</p>
                  <p>That there ſhould be a Governor, a Deputy Governor, 12. Aſſiſtants, and names them; but to be continued by Election.</p>
                  <p>That they ſhould have the ſole Trade to theſe Iſlands. And that none other ſhould haunt or viſit thoſe Iſlands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pain of Forfeiture and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: With <hi>non obſtante</hi> to the Statute of Monoopolies.</p>
                  <p>Judgment was given againſt this Patent.</p>
                  <p>Here is in this Caſe, the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Preamble, asin yours. The Abuſe of the Trade, and the Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, for the general good was the thing pretended, but few Men doubt what was intended.</p>
                  <p>Under the Name of Regulation and Government, to ingroſs all into the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34988:102"/>Hands of 10 or 12 Men, is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Regulation and Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 2. And as to other Companies and Charters that have been granted.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing that all theſe Grants were ſuch as this, and practiſed and uſed as this; yet 'tis no Argument that they were legal or good Grants.</p>
                  <p>Have not there been in all Ages and Times, Patents and Grants, ſuch as by Law were void and of no Force? If it be ſo; it is no Argument that becauſe there have been many ſuch Grants, therefore this is good.</p>
                  <p>But to keep my ſelf to Monopolies.</p>
                  <p>Monopolies have been frequently in all Times granted; even in the beſt of Times; many by Queen <hi>Elizabeth. Darcy</hi>'s was granted by her. In the Recital of it appears, that there had been granted before it, divers others of that Monopoly of ſole ſelling and making Cards.</p>
                  <p>But when it came in Queſtion, it was condemned.</p>
                  <p>Stat. 9 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. And the other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes before cited. The Clauſes that ſay that all Patents granted or to be granted, contrary to the Freedom of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34988:103"/>Trade in theſe Statutes mentioned, Prove,
<list>
                        <item>1. That ſuch Patents had been.</item>
                        <item>2. That they did foreſee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt thoſe that would be.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>43 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. That Proviſo ſhews that there were Monopolies granted; but yet ſo far from receiving any Allowance, that that Statute made in the End of her Reign, for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Patents, by ſpecial Proviſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and provides,</p>
                  <p>That that Statute ſhall not extend to make good any Letters Patents made or granted, of and concerning Licences, Powers, or Privileges, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Monopolies.</p>
                  <p>The Statute of Monopolies, and this Statute, ſufficiently ſhew that there were ſuch Grants, and that they were not allowed. This therefore is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, it hath not, nor cannot be ſhewn (as I believe) that ever any had any Judicial Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in any Times paſt for any ſole Trade, or ſole buying or ſelling, which is a great Argument to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And further,</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34988:103"/>
                  <p>The Practice of theſe Companies hath been generally to the contrary; and till within theſe late Years, no ſole Trade practiced amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>This and the Charters to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the reſt perhaps are in this particular alike <hi>(viz.)</hi> that there is in Words granted to them the ſole Trade: But the Uſe and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Charters vaſtly differ.</p>
                  <p>For the great Companies, <hi>Turkey, Muſcovy, Ruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Hamborough</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they trade not by any joynt Stock, but the Members of each Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, every Man uſes his own Trade, buys and ſells his own Commodities, hath his own Servants, Factors, and Imployers.</p>
                  <p>They take care, by ſending out Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Agents, to preſerve the Trade; and by ſmall Impoſts, maintain ſuch Conſuls and Agents.</p>
                  <p>They take care that the Market be not overſtock'd or glutted with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities they ſend out; and therefore only order what Ships ſhall go, but leave to every one of the Company to ſend his Merchandize at his own Will and Pleaſure.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:34988:104"/>
                  <p>They trade not upon any Joynt Stock, or the Stock of the Body-Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. If you deal with any of them, you know your Chapman: No Man is refuſed to be free of their Companies that hath a mind, paying ſome ſmall Sum for his Freedom.</p>
                  <p>But this Company of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> are of quite another Nature, and uſe their Patent to quite another End.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company trade only upon the Company's Stock; every Man, whether Merchant or not, if he can buy ſuch a Share in their Stock, is of their Company.</p>
                  <p>The Committee manage, and the reſt muſt ſubmit to their Pleaſures and Diſtributions: Thoſe few of them that have the moſt Shares, have the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the whole Stock: No Member trades, buys or ſells, or hath any thing that he calls his own, but only ſuch a Share in the Stock: No Member of theirs either buys or ſells his own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, or imploys any Factors or Servants. The Body Politick, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Corporation trade, perhaps for 1000000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> They get into their Hands, and ſell perhaps 7. or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34988:104"/>800000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Merchandize at a time: The three laſt Sales that they made, came to 1800000 <hi>l.</hi> No body hath theſe Commodities but they.</p>
                  <p>Is this trading, and no ingroſſing or no monopolizing? 'Tis their wonderful Vertue, their Hatred and Contempt of Riches that makes them not to raiſe and encreaſe Values and Prizes, and be as rich as they pleaſe, if they do not do it. No Man is admitted to come into their Company by their Patent to have a Vote, unleſs he have 500 <hi>l.</hi> in their Stock, which values above 1500 <hi>l.</hi> to be bought: So that by the very Foundation, they can have no more Perſons in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, than they have 500 <hi>l.</hi> Shares, and theſe Shares being ingroſſed into few Hands, the few Hands have all, and call themſelves the Company.</p>
                  <p>So that Men that will not be deceived by Words, but diſtinguiſh things diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from the other, will diſtinguiſh bet wixt one Company and Society, and another, who are Ingroſſers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizers, and who not.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turkey</hi> Company, and the reſt like it, may truly be ſaid to be Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Regulaters, and Improvers of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34988:105"/>Trade. They have no joynt Stock that they trade upon; they ingroſs not; they admit every Man that will, to be free of their Companies, to trade with his own Mony, his own Credit, and buy and ſell his own, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy whom he pleaſeth, and none amongſt them, under Pretence of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Regulation and Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Trade, makes unreaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                  <p>But the inviſible <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the Body Politick covers and countenances ſome few Men amongſt them, to engroſs, buy and ſell at their own Rates, and excludes all others from the great and exceſſive Advantage of the few.</p>
                  <p>The other Companies, as the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> &amp;c. have not any ſole buying or ſelling; nor exerciſing any ſole Trade or ingroſſing. Every Member of theſe Companies, which are a Multitude, and every one that is not, may, if he will, be a Member; no Man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>But this Company quite contrary; and therefore if ever any was, theſe are great Engroſſers and Monopolizers of Trade.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:34988:105"/>
                  <p>I do not argue or ſpeak againſt Companies, nor regulating or manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade (which was the true intent of this Patent) ſuch as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is vertuouſly and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly practiſed in the great Companies of <hi>Turky, Muſcovy, Hamborough</hi> and others, where the Members of the Company trade upon their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Stocks and Eſtates, and no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant hindred or denied to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that deſires it, paying his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fees of Admiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But againſt the Inviſible Merchant, this politick Capacity trading in joynt Stocks.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a like Patent to any one, or two or three Men, Farmers or Partners, in their private Capacity, of this ſole Trade, and they had the Management of it, and thereby Poſſeſſors of ſuch vaſt Wealth and Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>What would this politick Body (I mean the principal Members; for the Body can't think or have Senſe) judge of it?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps yours is much worſe, there a Man ſhould know with whom he dealt, who were his Debtors, and how
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34988:106"/>to come to them; but dealing with you is a kind of dealing with Spirits, an Inviſible Body ſubſiſting only <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligentia legis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore being ſo unlike the other Companies, and ſo contrary to them, you ought to have no Countenance from them; and though they are good and commendable, you are Ingroſſers and Monopolizers.</p>

                  <p>By the Deſcription of a Monopoly, which I have before, out of my <hi>Lord Cook,</hi> ſtated and expreſſed; This ſole Trade granted to you, and the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all others, is a Monopoly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Deſcription, as I have before ſhewn.</p>

                  <p>For you have granted to you the ſole Trade, which includes all buying, ſelling, ſole uſing. That appropriates all to your ſelves, and excludes all others.</p>

                  <p>How then can the Plaintiff, in this Caſe do it?</p>
                  <p>In the Comment upon this Statute,<note place="margin">3 Inſt. 182.</note> 'tis there ſaid, that this Act is forcibly and vehemently penn'd for the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Monopolies.</p>
                  <p>And the Words <hi>[Sole uſing]</hi> is there ſaid to be ſo general, as no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly can be raiſed, but will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reach of this Statute.</p>
                  <p>The Word <hi>[any thing]</hi> ſhews alſo the general Scope and Intent, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be excluded that was a Monopoly.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the Proviſo excepts Charters to Companies or Societies of Merchants, erected for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Enlargement, or Ordering of any Trade or Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. This Proviſo extends not to this Charter, or any Letters Patents granted after the making of that Act. And this appears from the penning of the Proviſo.</p>
                  <p>The enacting Clauſe ſaith, <q>That all Letters Patents, granted or to be granted for ſole buying any thing, ſhall be void.</q>

                  <p>The Proviſo ſaith,</p>

                     <q>That this Act ſhall not extend to, or be prejudicial to Towns Corporate concerning any Charters granted to them, or Cuſtoms uſed by them.</q>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This extends to thoſe that were granted and erected. Here is no Words of ſalving for any that ſhould be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after granted or erected: the Words <hi>[hereafter to be granted,]</hi> would have been in this Clauſe of ſalving, as well as in the enacting Clauſe, if ever ſo intended. But the following Words concluding this Proviſo, further ſhew it,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the Charters, Corporations, Companies, Fellowſhips, and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and their Liberties, Privileges, Powers, and Immunities ſhall be and continue as they were before the making of this Act.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This governs and concludes the whole Proviſo, and extends only to thoſe that then were, to leave them as they were. That is,</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:34988:109"/>
                  <p>To leave the Charters and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, their Powers and Privileges in the ſame State and Condition as they were before this Act.</p>
                  <p>The Beginning of the Proviſo ſaith, this Act ſhall not prejudice them; the Concluſion ſaith, they ſhall be as they were before this Act was made.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe that were excepted muſt have a Being before this Act: No Words therein extend to thoſe that then had not a Being.</p>
                  <p>The next Proviſo for Printing, Salt-Peter, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expreſly provides for Patents granted or to be granted.</p>
                  <p>This (if ſo intended) would no doubt in like manner have been penn'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 2. But ſuppoſe it ſhould be conſtrued to extend to Companies, Privileges, and Immunities erected and granted after this Act.</p>
                  <p>Yet you are not within this ſaving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For it extends only to Companies and Societies erected for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Enlargement or ordering of Trade or Merchandize, and to their Powers and Privileges that they have for that End.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34988:109"/>
                  <p>Not to Companies and Societies erected to have a ſole Trade by a joynt Stock, or a Stock of the Corporation, excluding all others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turky</hi> Company, <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and other Companies, that trade not as Bodies politick, or upon joynt Stocks, but every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that will, may be thereof a Member, and every Member thereof trade upon his own private Stock and Account of a Merchant.</p>
                  <p>The Companies only order an con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult for Maintenance and Preſervation of it, and not for the ingroſſing and couſening their Members of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Corporations that are within this Exception and Proviſo.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt be as ſilly as the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels you deal with in theſe Matters, not to diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and their Management, and yours.</p>
                  <p>They exclude none from Trade; they trade not in a publick Capacity, in a ſole Stock, but every Member is a Trader upon his own peculiar Stock.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:34988:110"/>
                  <p>But you take upon you in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Capacity, as you have expreſſed in your Declaration,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Totum integrum &amp; ſolum Commercium &amp; negotiationem habere uti &amp; gaudere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to exclude, not only all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but all your own Members to have any diſtinct or ſeparate Trade upon their ownaccount (except a little to excuſe you to pay off Charges) and thereby ingroſs all that vaſt Quantity of Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>The many 100000 <hi>l.</hi> worth you bring in and carry out: In whom is the Property?</p>
                  <p>In the Corporation.</p>
                  <p>Who buys and ſells all?</p>
                  <p>The Corporation.</p>
                  <p>Who are the Debtors for the Mony, that buys and provides theſe Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes?</p>
                  <p>The Body Politick, the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the inviſible Body.</p>
                  <p>Who ſhall be ſued for theſe Debts?</p>
                  <p>The Body Politick.</p>
                  <p>Sue them as you can, they will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be too rich and great to contend with, or elſe in that Condition as you know not how or where to have them;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34988:110"/>they are an inviſible Body, ſubſiſting only <hi>in intelligentia legis,</hi> a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, without Soul or Conſcience, as the Law ſays it to be.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen them in a Years time in both theſe Qualifications; ſo great as ſcarce any Man will contend with them; ſo inviſible at another time, as a Dun could ſcarce find them.</p>
                  <p>This ſurely can't be for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Enlargement of Trade, to deal with I know not whom, where no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or perſon is ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed for the Maintenance of the Company's Trade, to enable ſome of them to get 10 or 20000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> by it, and to keep this vaſt Trade in a few Hands.</p>
                  <p>But ſure this is not the Trade the Proviſo intends.</p>
                  <p>Reſtraining to the Body Politick, which is but one Perſon or Man in Partnerſhip, is quite contrary to the Enlargement in the Proviſo mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, to ſay that you are within the ſaving, by this Proviſo; a Company erected for the Maintenance and Enlargement of Trade, when you
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34988:111"/>reſtrain all but your ſelves to trade, ſeems to be a Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>And for the following Words in the Proviſo,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Or ordering of any Trade or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ſay you are ſaved within the Extent of theſe Words, then muſt you make a Conſtruction of theſe Words in this Senſe.</p>
                  <p>That ordering Trade and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize is excluding all others, and taking the whole to your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>A moſt excellent ordering indeed.</p>
                  <p>But the true Senſe of theſe Words in this Proviſo, is to ſave the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Fellowſhips of Arts, Trades, Occupations, and Myſteries, and to Companies of Merchants, the Powers and Authorities that they had for the Maintenance, Enlargement, or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trade.</p>
                  <p>By taking care that the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were honeſtly and rightly made, without Fraud or Deceit in their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or Quantities.</p>
                  <p>That the Servants and younger ſort were honeſt, and induſtriouſly educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Trades and Myſteries, by the Maſters and elder ſort.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:34988:111"/>
                  <p>To place and keep good Order and Decorum amongſt thoſe of the ſame Myſtery and Trade.</p>
                  <p>For aſſembling and conſulting for the common Good, and Management of their reſpective Trades and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>This is that which the Proviſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and provides for.</p>
                  <p>Not for a ſole Trade in a Company, in a joynt Stock, excluding all others as this is.</p>
                  <p>The Company there made a By-Law,<note place="margin">Taylors of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> Caſe, 11 Rep. 54.</note> to exclude Taylors from uſing their Trades within that Town, unleſs by the Maſters and Wardens of the Company, or three of them admitted to be a ſufficient Workman.</p>
                  <p>In this Caſe here ſeemed to be a good End and Meaning, to exclude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Workmen, and encourage good Workmen; a good Order one might think.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſo jealous and careful they then were, leſt, under any Pretence they ſhould exclude Men from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trades that they adjudged this a void By-Law, as tending to reſtrain Men of their Freedom in uſing their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34988:112"/>Trades, and introducing Oppreſſion of the young Tradeſmen, by the old and rich Tradeſmen.</p>
                  <p>And in that Caſe adjudged,</p>
                  <p>That Ordinances for the good Order and Government of Men of Trades and Myſteries are good, but not to reſtrain Men in their lawful Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe is <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Stop</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hob.</hi> 211.</p>
                  <p>So that this being the Senſe of this Proviſo, to except Powers and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities that Companies have to regulate Trade, for the Maintenance and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of it, but not to reſtrain any from their Trades or lawful Myſteries, it extends not to ſalve or preſerve ſuch Authority or Power in you to have a ſole Trade, excluding all others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For another reaſon, it cannot be the Senſe of this Proviſo, to except or ſave to any Body Politick, the buying in their publick Capacity, a ſole Trade.</p>
                  <p>The Proviſo then will be repugnant and contradictory to the enacting Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For taking the Proviſo as they would have it;</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:34988:112"/>
                  <p>To ſave to Bodies Politick the having the ſole buying and ſelling, and uſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Merchandize or Trade as a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and then compare the Proviſo with the enacting Clauſe, and it will be juſt thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Enacted, That Letters Patents to any Body Politick, for ſole buying, ſelling, or uſing any thing, ſhall be void. And that no Body Politick ſhall be capable of having, uſing, or exerciſing any ſuch Patent, Inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Reſtraint.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Provided that Bodies Politick may have the ſole buying, ſelling, and uſing any Trade:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contradictory? Examine it as much as you can, and it will be no other than a down-right Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Statute that enacts, that no Man ſhall uſe a Trade that he hath not ſerved an Apprentice to, by the Space of ſeven Years, had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo.</p>
                  <p>That Men might uſe a Trade that they had not ſerved an Apprentice to by the Space of ſeven Years.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34988:113"/>
                  <p>This had ben a void repugnant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo.</p>
                  <p>This is as plainly repugnant,</p>
                  <p>That no Body Politick ſhall be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having a ſole Trade,</p>
                  <p>Provided that a Body may have a ſole Trade.</p>
                  <p>And repugnant Proviſos are in Law void.</p>
                  <p>Statute gives the Land of <hi>J. S.</hi> to the King:<note place="margin">1 Rep. 46. Pl. Com. 563.</note> Then a Proviſo comes to ſave the Right of all Perſons.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall be conſtrued, all Perſons beſides <hi>J. S.</hi> not to deſtroy the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when the Act ſaith, <q>That all Patents granted to Bodies Politick for ſole buying and ſelling or uſing any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall the Proviſo that ſaith, That it ſhall not extend or be prejudicial to Companies of Merchants erected for the Maintenance, Enlargement, or order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trade,</p>
                  <p>If conſtrued in the ſame Senſe that they would have it, to give the Companies ſole buying, ſelling, and uſing any thing as Companies in their Corporate Capacity, it is repugnant and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:34988:113"/>
                  <p>But to give the Companies the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, Order, and Government, is the Senſe as I conceive.</p>
                  <p>And this is the general Practice of the Societies and Companies allowed in all times.</p>
                  <p>But a ſole Trade, under the Colour and Pretence of Order and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, never, as I believe, hath had any judicial Allowance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Another thing that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the other ſide, have objected to evade this Act, hath been this. The Proviſo is;</p>
                  <p>That the Act ſhall not extend to Companies of Merchants erected for Maintenance and Ordering of Trade, but that their Charters, Liberties, and Privileges ſhall be of like Force as they were before the making this Act.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, ſay they, Patents to Companies of Merchants for ordering Trade, if good before this Act, ſhall be good ſtill; and therefore, ſay they, the Act can't hurt us.</p>
                  <p>This is curious, but if examined, is but the ſame Objection in other Words.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:34988:114"/>
                  <p>For the Concluſion of this Proviſo extends no further than the Charters mentioned in the Beginning of it: It extends but to the ſame Charters; ſo are the very Words.</p>
                  <p>What Charters or Patents then ſhall remain in the ſame Force they were before the Act?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are excepted.</p>
                  <p>What are excepted?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are for Order and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; as I have before ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>Not thoſe that are for ſole Trade granted to a Body Politick. That is repugnant to the enacting Clauſe; therefore thoſe (as I have ſaid) are not excepted or within the Proviſo.</p>
                  <p>If then not excepted, you are moſt plainly and fully within the enacting Clauſe, and your Patent quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, and void by this Act; unleſs the matter of Infidel will ſave you.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But this is a ſole Trade with Infidels, and ſuch a Trade the Subject had never any Right to have without the King's Licence. And to prove it, they cite <hi>Michelburne's</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherein Mr. <hi>Brownlow</hi> being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotary,<note place="margin">2. Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 296.</note> doth relate what my Lord
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34988:114"/>
                     <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid, That no Subject of the King might trade with any Realm of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, without the King's Licence.</p>
                  <p>And that the Reaſon was becauſe he might relinquiſh the Catholick Faith, and adhere to Infideliſm: And that he had ſeen a Licence in the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. where the King recited the Confidence that he had in his Subject, that he would not decline his Religion; and ſo licenced him.</p>
                  <p>And that this did ariſe upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of a Licence made to trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They cite alſo <hi>Calvin's</hi> Caſe, 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 17. where 'tis ſaid, That Infidels are <hi>perpetui inimici;</hi> there is perpetual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, there can be no Peace; an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del can maintain no Action, nor have any thing within this Realm; and to prove this there is cited, <hi>R.</hi> 282.12 <hi>H.</hi> 8.4.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Suppoſing the Law to be as theſe Books intend, and as the other ſide urge them, and the Conſequence will be, that the Plaintiff can't maintain this Action, but that the Charter grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, is void.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon that is given in <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>'s Caſe is grounded upon this: That
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34988:115"/>the King hath the Care and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion by the Law veſted in him: That his Subjects ſhall not trade with Infidels, leſt thereby they may be brought to relinquiſh the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, and adhere to Infideliſm: And that the King ſhall take care, that Licences to trade be only given to ſuch as the King hath Confidence in, that they will not decline their Religion.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing this, then your Patent muſt be naught, for then it is only grantable to Perſons in whom ſuch Confidence may be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your Corporation or Body Politick is indefinite as to Perſons; the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof are daily changeable; ſome go out, ſell their Stocks, or dye; others buy their Stocks, and are daily coming in to be Members of your Company.</p>
                  <p>I doubt you do not much examine, nor care how fixed or certain thoſe are in Religion, that come into your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>How then can there be any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Body Politick?</p>
                  <p>The Law ſaith, that a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick hath neither Soul nor Conſcience:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34988:115"/>What Confidence then concerning their Religion can there be in a Body Politick?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis not only the Members of the Company that were at the Time of the Corporation, but thoſe that after ſhould be Members, and their Sons, their Apprentices, Factors, and Servants that are licenſed by this Patent.</p>
                  <p>If licenſing to trade with Infidels be a Truſt and Prerogative in the King, to be given to ſuch Perſons in whom the King can have Confidence, that they will not be converſing with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, change or prejudice;</p>
                  <p>This can't be granted to a Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and their Succeſſors, which may have Continuance for ever; or to their Sons Factors, Apprentices, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Perſons altogether unknown, not born, nor <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> when the Patent was made.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe ſuch a Licence to you to trade with Enemies. I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppoſing it to be in the King's Prerogative, in Preſervation of Religion to licence; yet he can't grant this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to you, that you ſhall have Power to grant Licence to whom you will.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:34988:116"/>
                  <p>Yet all this is done by your Patent; for you have not only thereby Power granted you for your Apprentices, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Servants, which are Perſons that you your ſelves nominate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point at your Diſcretions; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly very religious:</p>
                  <p>But by your Patent it is expreſly granted, that the Company, for any Conſideration or Benefit to themſelves, may grant Licences to any Merchant, Stranger, or other, to trade to or from the <hi>Indies:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the King will not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Company, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence any other to trade.</p>
                  <p>Can this be a good Grant? Can the King grant from himſelf his Kingly Care and Truſt for Preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to you, that you ſhall manage it, and that the King will not uſe ſuch his Power without your Conſent?</p>
                  <p>So that ſuppoſing that there is, by the Law, ſuch a Truſt repoſed in the King, for Preſervation of Religion, as you would have it; yet the Grant to you is void in it ſelf, and then you have no more Right than we, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently can maintain no Action againſt us.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:34988:116"/>
                  <p n="2">2. To conſider the Books that you have cited to maintain this religious Point.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Brownlow's Reports,</hi> a Book print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the late Times, not licenſed by any Judge or Perſon whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The Roll is, <hi>Michelburn</hi> againſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurst,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mich. 7 Jac. B. C. Rot. 3107.</note> ſetting forth, that the King had granted the Plaintiff his Commiſſion to go with his Ship <hi>Tiger,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> to ſpoil and ſuppreſs the Infidels, and to take from them what he could. That there were Articles betwixt the Parties for Account and Shares of what ſhould be got, and upon thoſe Articles a Suit in the Admiralty.</p>
                  <p>And what is it that is in the Caſe? Nothing to the purpoſe; but the Book mentions only what my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid upon the Motion for the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Only a ſudden occaſional Saying, not upon any Argument or Debate, nor to the then Caſe.</p>
                  <p>So that a Man muſt be very willing that will much rely upon ſuch a Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I can't call it an Authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe;</p>
                  <p>That an Infidel is <hi>perpetuus Inimicus,</hi> and can maintain no Action, or have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34988:117"/>any thing, and that we are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Hoſtility, and no Peace can be made with them.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that this is ſaid in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Caſe; but there was nothing there in Judgment that gave Occaſion for it, ſo that I can't think that it was much conſidered before it was ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>The Books there cited to prove it are, <hi>Reg.</hi> 282. And all that I can find therein, is, that in a Writ of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, granted to the Hoſpitallers of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John's</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is ſaid, that the Hoſpital was founded in Defence of Holy Church againſt the Enemies of Chriſt and Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But doth this prove, that Infidels are <hi>perpetui Inimici,</hi> with whom no Peace can be made, that can maintain no Action?</p>
                  <p>The other Book cited is, 12 <hi>H.</hi> 8.4. <hi>a</hi> Treſpaſs brought for taking away a Dog, and in the debating whether this Action did lye or not; it is ſaid,</p>
                  <p>That if the Lord beat his Villain, an Husband his Wife, or a Man out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, or a Traitor, or a Pagan, they ſhall have no Action, becauſe they are not able to ſue an Action.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34988:117"/>
                  <p>So that this alſo is but Diſcourſe and ſudden Thoughts and Sayings, where the thing was not in Queſtion: And what Authority is there in ſuch Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? It is true, that Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Pagaiſm are ſo contrary one to the other, as impoſſible to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, no more than Contradictions can be reconciled.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe they can't be reconciled that therefore there ſhould be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al War betwixt them and us, perhaps is an irreligious Doctrine, and deſtroys all Means of convincing Infidels to the Faith.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, theſe extrajudicial and occaſional Sayings in theſe Books cited, are of little Authority: For I can't find any Book or Caſe, much leſs Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Authority for ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſo great a Point as this is.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, if a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the general Courſe and Practice, Trade and Commerce, and legal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; a Man would think, That my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> could not be in earneſt in what he hath ſaid about Infidels.</p>
                  <p>For let a Man conſider what a great Part of the World we have Commerce
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34988:118"/>with, that are Infidels, as <hi>Turks, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and other Countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> were alſo poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who were Infidels, till about the Year 1474. about 200 Years ſince they were driven out, for till then, for near the Space of 700 Years the <hi>Moors</hi> poſſeſſed both <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Have we not Leagues and Treaties with the Princes and Inhabitants of the Infidel Countries, receiving Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from them, and ſending Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to them, and Miniſters always reſiding with them? Have we not from Time to Time, Peace or War with them in like manner, as with Chriſtian Kings and Countries?</p>
                  <p>If Infidels be <hi>perpetui Inimici,</hi> if in perpetual Enmity, then we may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the killing of them, as thoſe that we are in Hoſtility with, whereſoever we meet with them.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 <hi>E.</hi> 4.13. <hi>b.</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7.15. Adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any Man may ſeize and take to his own Uſe, the Goods of an alien Enemy.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34988:118"/>
                  <p>'Tis the Price of his Adventure and Victory over his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>If an Infidel be any Enemy, any Man may then take away the Goods of an Infidel, and have them to his own Uſe: And this would be a good Trade if this be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> in his Argument, was pleaſed to cite many ancient Rolls out of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and <hi>E.</hi> 1. and about thoſe Times, concerning thoſe Princes hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Jews.</p>
                  <p>In Mr. <hi>Pryn's</hi> Book that he calls <hi>The ſecond Part of a ſhort Demurrer to the Jews long diſcontinued Remitter into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> printed in 1656.</p>
                  <p>In which Book, I believe, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Records and Hiſtories are cited to ſhew how they were about thoſe times handled.</p>
                  <p>The Time that they did exact, and much enrich themſelves by Uſury, to the great Impoveriſhment of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And that the Princes of thoſe Times polled them, taxed them, and took it from them again at Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But beſides Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Stat. of <hi>Merton, C.</hi> 5. made 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. was, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 89.</note> principally
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34988:119"/>intended againſt the uſurious Jews.</p>
                  <p>Stat. <hi>de Judaiſmo</hi> 18 <hi>E.</hi> 1. Recites, that the King's People were diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the uſurious Jews: And enacts, That no Jew, for the ſuture, ſhall take Uſury.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 507.</note> that 15060 Jews thereupon departed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>But for the Uſe that in arguing is made of this matter of the Jews and of the King's ſeizing their Eſtates, and pardoning for dealing with them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for thoſe ancient Records in general.</p>
                  <p>Time hath hidden the Knowledg of the Laws, and Tranſactions of thoſe Times: It is impoſſible to know what the Laws of thoſe Times were, or right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſtinguiſh betwixt legal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Acts: And to bring Inferences from thence, to conclude in Judgment now, is <hi>Notum per Ignotius:</hi> Or like Dependencies, which, unleſs latter Times have concurred or agreed with, are only fit to make Diſorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which is deducible from thence is not, as I conceive, what hath been endeavoured.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:34988:119"/>
                  <p>That is, that they had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, becauſe the Princes of thoſe Times took from them their Eſtates when they pleaſed, or taxed them how, and in what manner they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps the Reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe People lying under the Curſe, and being a vagrant People, without Head, Prince, or Governour, or Country; it was no Difficulty to tax, or take from them at Pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hated of the People where they lived.</p>
                  <p>For it could not be as they would have it, that they ſhould be amongſt us as alien Enemies; for an alien Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can make neither Bargain nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, nor be capable of Property.</p>
                  <p>But the Subject may, at his Will and Pleaſure, fall upon and take all that he hath to his own Uſe, as upon the King's Enemies; and what he can take from him is his own Acquiſition, as the Prize of his Adventure, and Conqueſt over his Enemy: And to prove this, two Books are cited, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34988:120"/>
                  <p>But by what is admitted by them, that they were great Uſurers, and had great Eſtates,</p>
                  <p>It is evident that they were treated as alien Amies: How could they elſe, in ſuch Multitudes, live amongſt us? How could they be Uſurers or get E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates if they could not make Contracts? How is it poſſible they could preſerve their Bodies or Eſtates againſt the King's Subjects, unleſs they had the King's Protection, and treated as alien Amies?</p>
                  <p>And of latter Times, how many of them have lived amongſt us, driven great Trades, have had, and have, at this preſent, conſiderable Eſtates?</p>
                  <p>Let it be now adjudged, that any Man that will, may take away their Eſtates, that they can have no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Action for any Debt owing to them, but inſtead thereof, may be beaten and impriſoned as Enemies to the King: And we ſhall probably ſee what the Succeſs of ſuch a Judgment will be.</p>
                  <p>The Act of Navigation, made the 12 Year of the King,<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. cap. 18.</note> concerning Trade, ſhews, that Infidels have the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Trade as others.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:34988:120"/>
                  <p>That Act being made for Encreaſe of Shipping and Navigation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Goods to be imported by any foreign Ships, except the Ships of the ſame Country where the Goods do grow or ariſe, diſtinguiſheth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Infidel and Chriſtian Countries: But expreſly ſaith, <q>That Currants, nor Commodities of the Growth of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, ſhall be imported but by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Ships of the Built of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Place where the Growth is, and whereof the Maſter of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners is of that Country or Place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Clauſe ſhews plainly, that the Infidels of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire have Liberty of Trade here.</p>
                  <p>And the Acts of Tunnage and Poundage tax all their Merchandizes without ſaying brought in.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Southern</hi> &amp; <hi>How</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Cr.</hi> 469. where a Man imployed another to ſell Jewels for him in <hi>Barbary,</hi> as true Jewels, and he ſold them to the King of <hi>Barbary</hi> for 800 <hi>l.</hi> as true Jewels, when they were counterfeit, and thereupon the King of <hi>Barbary</hi> finding himſelf cheated, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned the Plaintiff that ſold them,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34988:121"/>to him, till he repaid his Mony</p>
                  <p>In that Caſe 'twas of all ſides admitted, and not as much as objected, that this Contract was void, becauſe the King of <hi>Barbary</hi> was an Infidel.</p>
                  <p>So that this Opinion, that Infidels are perpetual Enemies, and in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Hoſtility, can maintain no Action, nor have any thing amongſt us, hath no Authority for its Foundation, but only ſome extrajudicial Sayings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Debate or Conſideration: And is againſt all the continual Practices of Princes and People at all Times.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps 'tis no ſmall Part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Men ſhould ſpeak and deal plainly and uprightly one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We do know that Religion hath been too often made a Cloak and Vail for other Ends and Purpoſes. It ſhould not be ſo: And I hope, will not be ſo uſed in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p>The Statutes that I have cited of <hi>Magna Charta, c.</hi> 9. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.2. and 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. All declare and enact the Freedom of Trade in general Words, except only ſuch as are in War with the King. In none of them is there any Exception of Trade with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>

                     <q>That they were impoſed upon by the Company of Merchants in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and forced to pay Duties.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I only make uſe of this Recital, to prove the free Paſſage there mentioned, to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to other Countries and Regions. There is no Diſtinction of Infidel from Chriſtian Country, though <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> had been ſo lately Infidel; and though moſt probably, the Trade they had then, was with <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> as well as with <hi>Venice:</hi> The Words <hi>[other Regions and Countries,]</hi> ſeem to imply as much, and the Freedom equal.</p>
                  <p>So that I think, as to this Objection, that Infidels are perpetual Enemies, that we have no Peace with them, nor they maintain any Action, or have any Property by our Law; I think the Authority to maintain it is none at all; The conſtant Practice, as well by Princes as People, has been always againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But be that Point of trading with or without Licence, how it will;</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:34988:122"/>
                  <p>That Point can't be ſufficient to found a Monopoly upon, that can't warrant a Grant of a ſole Trade, ſole buying, and ſole ſelling, to be granted to you and your Succeſſors, your Sons, your Servants, your Apprentices and Factors, and ſuch as you ſhall licenſe for ever.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Licence in Perpetuity, not only to thoſe that then were, but to their So<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and Succeſſors, and thoſe whom they ſhall licenſe for ever: And this into a very great Part of the World: And by the ſame Reaſon all <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Barbary,</hi> a great Part of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and other Parts of the World may be monopolized, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all Chriſtian Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Statute of Monopolies hath no Allowance or Exception for monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing to Infidel Countries.</p>
                  <p>That Statute is againſt all ſole buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſole ſelling, or ſole uſing any thing.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Turkey</hi> Trade was uſed long before that Time, as by the Charter granted 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> So was the <hi>Barbary,</hi> as by the Charter thereof; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the <hi>Indies</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:34988:123"/>
                  <p>And the Statute of Monopolies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo general (the Proviſo not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conſtruable, to except this Company out of the Extent of that Statute, unleſs all Patents that may be granted to Companies of Monopolies are, by that Exception or Proviſo, out of the Statute) and deſerving for the ſuppreſſing ſo great Evils as Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are, and always have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted:</p>
                  <p>I hope it will not be avoided upon an imaginary Difference in Law betwixt Infidel and Chriſtian Countries, to monopolize thereby the Trade, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of the greater Half of the World; as <hi>Turkey, Perſia, Barbary, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West-Indies;</hi> for thoſe of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> a great Part, I think, are Pagans.</p>
                  <p>In the great Debates that were about 3 and 4 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. about the King's Power of impoſing Rates,<note place="margin">Exch. 4. C. 1. Lane 24. 2 Inſt. 63.</note> Subſidies, or Impoſitions upon Merchandize, in <hi>Bates</hi> his Caſe; and in the Parliaments are many things ſaid concerning the King's Power of prohibiting Trade.</p>
                  <p>Reſtraining by a <hi>Ne exeat Regno.</hi> And from theſe Arguments they reaſon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34988:123"/>the Lawfulneſs of Impoſition upon Merchandize.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments and Reaſons in thoſe Debates did not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Infidel and Chriſtian Countries. But betwixt Native and Foreign Commodities or Merchandize: And did endeavour to have a Prerogative to tax foreign Commodities.</p>
                  <p>And their Reaſons run thus,</p>
                  <p>The King can prohibit or reſtrain any Merchant to go out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: He can reſtrain any ſort of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commodities to be imported: If he can reſtrain, then none can go or import contrary to ſuch Reſtriction or Prohibition without Licence. Then the Licence is grantable upon Payment of ſuch or ſuch Duty or Impoſition, or as it can be agreed for and had; and conſequently ſuch Impoſition, Farm, or Rent lawful.</p>
                  <p>And in the Argument of thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it appears that a Reſtraint in its Conſequence may import a Tax, or an Impoſition, or Rent or Farm.</p>
                  <p>If Licences be requiſite, whether that will introduce Rates to be impoſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34988:124"/>otherwiſe than by Act of Parliament, may be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe it true, that there have been Licences granted, to go into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Countries. So there have been to go beyond Seas.</p>
                  <p>But it is no Conſequence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch have been granted, that therefore it is unlawful to go or trade without Licences.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs doth it follow from thence, that ſuch a Patent as this to any one or few Subjects to have the whole and ſole Trade into any one Place, can be warranted.</p>
                  <p>I do not queſtion but the King may reſtrain the Paſſage of Merchants and Merchandize in ſome Caſes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargue Ships in ſome Caſes. But theſe are upon ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In Caſes of War.</item>
                     <item>2. In Caſes of ſuch Merchandizes as are neceſſary for the Safety or Defence of the Kingdom, to reſtrain their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</item>
                     <item>3. In Caſes of Plague from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Place to import.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But then theſe Prohibitions are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and their particular Reaſons and Grounds are apparent.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:34988:124"/>
                  <p>But if under any Pretence, any ſole Trade to ſome one Perſon, Body-poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or Natural, be granted, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all others, That Grant is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in Deceit of the King, and to the Prejudice of his Subjects, and void.</p>
                  <p>Never any ſuch Grant hath hitherto had any judicial Allowance; but ſo far from that, that as far as I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, no Opinion hath been, till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 4 or 5 Years, that ſuch Grants were good to exclude others: Nor any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Suit ever adventured before now to be brought upon any ſuch Ground.</p>
                  <p>But if the Law ſhould be ſo, and that the Defendant ought not to have traded there without Licenſe,</p>
                  <p>Then he may be puniſhable at the King's Suit, by Fine and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But that you ſhould maintain an Action againſt him; what Cauſe of Action, or what Damage or Loſs to you have you laid in your Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                  <p>You ſay in your Declaration. <q>That the Defendant <hi>Sands,</hi> not being a Member of the Company, nor Son, Servant, Factor, Apprentice, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34988:125"/>of the Company, traded and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandized in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> within the Places granted to you by your Charter, and hath there bargained and ſold Wares and Merchandizes, and there bought others, and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſold them in <hi>England,</hi> againſt the Will of the Company, to their Prejudice and Impoveriſhment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Form of the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to the Damage of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. You have not alledged that he had no Licenſe from the King.</item>
                     <item>2. You have not ſhewn any Loſs or Damage that you have.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Did he buy ſo much Merchandize in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as that he left not there ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for you to furniſh your Ships withall, ſo that they came home emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                  <p>No ſuch thing is alledged.</p>
                  <p>Or did he here export, to ſell ſo much Merchandize, as not ſufficient left for you to buy here?</p>
                  <p>No ſuch thing alledged in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
                  <p>Or did he bring home here ſo much as that there were not Buyers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34988:125"/>for his Goods and your's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo?</p>
                  <p>No ſuch thing is alledged.</p>
                  <p>Or is the Truth ſo, as that hereby your impoſing your Prizes upon your own Commodities, ſelling at your own Rates, and exacting what you thought fit, was hindred; and for this you would maintain an Action?</p>
                  <p>It will be the firſt Time, I think, that a Man did ever recover Damages for being hindred of impoſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting his own Prizes, or having the Advantage of his Monopoly.</p>
                  <p>A Commoner may bring an Action of the Caſe againſt a Stranger, who puts in his Cattel into the Common; provided that thereby the Common be impaired, and the Commoner have not ſufficient Common, as before, but have a Damage; otherwiſe he can maintain no Action.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, that for every feeding of the Beaſts of a Stranger in a Common,<note place="margin">Co. 9 Rep. 113.</note> the Commoner ſhall not have an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize or Action upon the Caſe, but the feeding ought to be ſuch, that thereby the Commoner cannot have Common of Paſture for his own Beaſts.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:34988:126"/>
                  <p>'Tis the Conſequence, the Loſs of his Common that gives him Cauſe of Action.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not alledged in the Declaration, that your Trade was any thing the worſe: No Damage to you appears by it.</p>
                  <p>What Reaſon is there that you ſhould recover Damages where you have not ſuſtained any Loſs? And if you have alledged none in your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how can your Declaration be good? It then contains no Cauſe of Action.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Point in that Caſe is there reſolved,<note place="margin">11 Co. Rep. 88. b. Rols Abr. 1 part. 106.</note> that admitting the Patent good, yet no Action would lye.</p>
                  <p>In that Caſe the Queen, by her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, had granted to Mr. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cey,</hi> that he, his Servants, Factors, and Deputies, the whole Trade, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and Merchandize of Cards for 12 Years ſhould have and uſe: That none elſe ſhould uſe the Trade, nor buy or ſell Cards: That the Defendant did, contrary to this Patent ſell Cards.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Adjudged that this was a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly, and the Patent void.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if the Patent had been
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34988:126"/>good, yet no Action would have lyen againſt the Defendant upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But for another Reaſon you can't maintain this Action.</p>
                  <p>It is grounded upon the Reſtraint and Prohibition of others to trade, contained in the Letters Patents.</p>
                  <p>That Reſtraint or Prohibition is not an abſolute Reſtraint or Prohibition, but <hi>ſub modo,</hi> under a Pain of Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ship and Goods; One half to the King, another half to you that are the Company.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſing all that you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; That this Patent ſhould have the Force and Vertue of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſuch an Action as this could not be maintained upon it; but you muſt ſue for the Forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>For whenſoever a new Law is made, you muſt take that new Law as it is, and it can't be extended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Co.</hi> 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 37. 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 59. and <hi>Pl. Com.</hi> 206. All prove it.</p>
                  <p>Stat. <hi>E.</hi> 6. gives treble Damages for not ſetting out of Tithes.</p>
                  <p>Can the Party wave this Way, and bring an Action of the Caſe? Yet here the Damages are given to the Party.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:34988:127"/>
                  <p>The like of all other penal Statutes; a Man muſt forfeit only the Penalty the Statute inflicts.</p>
                  <p>So that this Action cannot, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, be maintained.</p>
                  <p>So that to conclude:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which this Company claims in this Caſe by this Patent, to have the ſole Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> in their Politick Capacity, excluding all others, is a Monopoly and ingroſſing againſt the common Law; the ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; the Statute of Monopolies 21 <hi>Jac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore they have no Right to have what they claim.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That what the Defendant hath in this Caſe done, he hath lawfully done, and therefore not to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That though the Company had a lawful Claim to the Trade in ſuch manner as in their Declaration ſet forth, and the Defendant have done what he ought not, yet they can't main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Action.</p>
                  <p>And upon the whole matter, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſt for the Company to have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34988:127"/>Judgment for them or againſt them, may deſerve their Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And this being ſo great in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqence, as the whole Trade of the Kingdom depending upon it, I have laboured the more.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Laws, the ancient Ways, is what I endeavour, and againſt new Ways upon any Pretence whatſoever.</p>
